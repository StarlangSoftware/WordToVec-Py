anarchism is often defined as a political philosophy which holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary or harmful
however others argue that while anti statism is central it is inadequate to define anarchism
therefore they argue instead that anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organization in the conduct of human relations including but not limited to the state system
proponents of anarchism known as anarchists advocate stateless societies based on non hierarchical free association s as a subtle and anti dogmatic philosophy anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy
anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy
there are many types and traditions of anarchism not all of which are mutually exclusive
anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism
strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications
anarchism is often considered a radical left wing ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics
anarchism as a mass social movement has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity
the central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by anarcho communism and anarcho syndicalism with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organizations
many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression supporting self defense or non violence anarcho pacifism while others have supported the use of some coercive measures including violent revolution and propaganda of the deed on the path to an anarchist society
etymology and terminology the term derives from the ancient greek ἄναρχος anarchos meaning without rulers from the prefix ἀν an without ἀρχός arkhos leader from ἀρχή arkhē authority sovereignty realm magistracy ισμός ismos from the suffix ιζειν izein izing
anarchists was the term adopted by maximilien de robespierre to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the french revolution but was determined to get rid of though among these anarchists there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists
there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs
pierre joseph proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist making the formal birth of anarchism the mid nineteenth century
since the 1890s from france the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the united states its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states
on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism
history origins the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan
zhuangzi s philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist
zhuangzi wrote a petty thief is put in jail
a great becomes a ruler of a nation
diogenes of sinope and the cynic s their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics
jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition
georges lechartier wrote that the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles
such a distinction reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic taoist teachings and that of other anti authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible
this is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry
the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de la boétie has been said to write an important anarchist precedent in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude
the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in england
the term anarchist first entered the english language in 1642 during the english civil war as a term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents
by the time of the french revolution some such as the enragés began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoron ic
by the turn of the 19th century the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation
modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jean jacques rousseau s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom
there were a variety of anarchist currents during the french revolution with some revolutionaries using the term anarchiste in a positive light as early as september 1793
the enragés opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms
denouncing the jacobin dictatorship jean varlet wrote in 1794 that government and revolution are incompatible unless the people wishes to set its constituted authorities in permanent insurrection against itself
during the french revolution sylvain maréchal in his manifesto of the equals 1796 demanded the communal enjoyment of the fruits of the earth and looked forward to the disappearance of the revolting distinction of rich and poor of great and small of masters and valets of governors and governed
from this climate william godwin developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought
godwin was according to peter kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke
benjamin tucker instead credits josiah warren an american who promoted stateless and voluntary communities where all goods and services were private with being the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as anarchism
the first to describe himself as an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon a french philosopher and politician which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory
the anarcho communist joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian
unlike proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature
in 1844 in germany the post hegelian philosopher max stirner published the book the ego and its own which will later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism
anarchists active in the 1848 revolution in france included anselme bellegarrigue ernest coeurderoy joseph déjacque and pierre joseph proudhon
first international and the paris commune in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848 during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings
after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt
in 1864 the international workingmen s association sometimes called the first international united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats
due to its links to active workers movements the international became a significant organization
karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council
proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed marx s state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings
in 1868 following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom lpf russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international which had decided not to get involved with the lpf
they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property
at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction
subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads
bakunin characterised marx s ideas as centralist and predicted that if a marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against
anarchist historian george woodcock reports that the annual congress of the international had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in 1871 the general council called only a special conference in london
one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while a technical excuse that they had split away from the fédération romande was used to avoid inviting bakunin s swiss supporters
thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council s resolutions passed almost unanimously
most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers
in 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york
in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st imier congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist program
the paris commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from 18 march more formally from 28 march to 28 may 1871
the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco prussian war
anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune
they included george woodcock manifests that organized labor the anti authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and spontaneous organization of labor
in 1886 the federation of organized trades and labor unions fotlu of the united states and canada unanimously set 1 may 1886 as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard
in response unions across the united states prepared a general strike in support of the event
on 3 may in chicago a fight broke out when strikebreaker s attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd
the next day 4 may anarchists staged a rally at chicago s haymarket square
a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer
in the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other
seven police officers and at least four workers were killed
eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer
the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement
four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution
the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day
in 1890 a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made
the event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair
although it had initially been conceived as a once off event by the following year the celebration of international workers day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker s holiday
in 1907 the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri benoît broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen
various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism
a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade union ism
malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient
he thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials
malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it
the spanish workers federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain
the most successful was the confederación nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in 1910
before the 1940s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting 1 58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish civil war
the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association a federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922 with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in europe and latin america
in latin america in particular the anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish c n t as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation
the largest and most militant of these organizations was the federación obrera regional argentina it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions
propaganda of the deed and illegalism some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda
by the 1880s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicide s and tyrannicide s from 1905 onwards the russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations
illegalism as a practice emerged and within it the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society
moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt
france s bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism
however as soon as 1887 important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts
peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le révolté that a structure based on centuries of history can not be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite
a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement
the anarcho syndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter
state repression including the infamous 1894 french lois scélérates of the anarchist and labor movement s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts
the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the 1871 paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favored individualist political expression and acts
numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement
for example u s president mckinley s assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman
bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because international terrorism arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite
this image remains to this day
propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after world war i 1914 – 1918 and the 1917 october revolution
russian revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s anarchists participated alongside the bolshevik s in both february and october revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution
however following a political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the 1921 kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed
anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to the ukraine
there in the free territory they fought in the civil war against the whites a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months
expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were amongst those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising before they left russia
both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia criticizing the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised
for them bakunin s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true
the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally
many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements
in france and the united states for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww left the organizations and joined the communist international
the revolutionary wave of 1917 – 23 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism
in the german uprising known as the german revolution of 1918 – 1919 which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer silvio gesell and erich mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures
in the italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho syndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana grew to 800 000 members and the influence of the italian anarchist union 20 000 members plus umanita nova its daily paper grew accordingly anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces
in the mexican revolution the mexican liberal party was established and during the early 1910s it lead a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarcho communist ricardo flores magón
in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism
their 1926 manifesto called the organizational platform of the general union of anarchists draft was supported
platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america
synthesis anarchism emerged as an organizational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives
in the 1920s this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure
it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations
conflicts with european fascist regimes in the 1920s and 1930s the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism s conflict with the state
italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists
italian anarchists played a key role in the anti fascist organisation arditi del popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august 1922
the veteran italian anarchist luigi fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter revolution
in france where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february 1934 riots anarchists divided over a united front policy
anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii
in germany the anarchist erich mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 february 1933 within a few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin
joseph goebbels the nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those jewish subversives
over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg brandenburg and finally oranienburg
on 2 february 1934 mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 july 1934 mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning
spanish revolution in spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union confederación nacional del trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory
but in 1936 the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power
months later the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war 1936 – 1939
in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land
but even before the fascist victory in 1939 the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the stalinists who controlled the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet union
the events known as the spanish revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of the levante
much of spain s economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as 75 but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment
factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes
anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution which he claimed came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history
stalinist led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists
the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri who volunteered to fight against franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party
post war years anarchism sought to reorganize itself after the war
the mexican anarchist federation was established in 1945 after the anarchist federation of the center united with the anarchist federation of the federal district
in the early 1940s the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organization asociación libertaria de cuba cuban libertarian association
from 1944 to 1947 the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new communist regime
in 1945 in france the fédération anarchiste was established and the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy
korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september 1945 and in 1946 the japanese anarchist federation was founded
an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may 1948
after world war ii an appeal in the fraye arbeter shtime detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them
by february 1946 the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was a large scale operation
the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in 1947 and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ die freie gesellschaft which survived until 1953
in 1956 the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded
in 1955 the anarcho communist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation
the organizational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france
the syndicalist workers federation was a syndicalist group in active in post war britain and one of the solidarity federation s earliest predecessors
it was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain
unlike the afb which was influenced by anarcho syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the swf decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist worker centred strategy from the outset
anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as albert camus herbert read paul goodman dwight macdonald allen ginsberg george woodcock julian beck — and the french surrealist group led by andré breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the fédération anarchiste
anarcho pacifism became influential in the anti nuclear movement and anti war movement s of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarcho pacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day
anarcho pacifism became a basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war
the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert graham s anarchism a documentary history of libertarian ideas volume two the emergence of the new anarchism 1939 – 1977
contemporary anarchism a surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s
anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts
in 1968 in carrara italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing european federations of france the fédération anarchiste the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgaria n federation in french exile
in the united kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols
the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona spain
in denmark squatter s occupied a disused military base and declared the freetown christiania an autonomous haven in central copenhagen
since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged
although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s
the american civil rights movement and the movement against the war in vietnam also contributed to the revival of north american anarchism
european anarchism of the late 20th century drew much of its strength from the labour movement and both have incorporated animal rights activism
anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural critical ideas and who by the turn of the 21st century formed by far the majority of anarchists
around the turn of the 21st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movement s anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization wto group of eight and the world economic forum
some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police
these actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black bloc s other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet
a significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in 1999
according to anarchist scholar simon critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo libertarianism of contemporary neo liberalism one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally
international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations the international workers association and international libertarian solidarity
the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederación general del trabajo cgt and the cnt
cgt membership was estimated at around 100 000 for 2003
other active syndicalist movements include in sweden the central organisation of the workers of sweden and the swedish anarcho syndicalist youth federation the cnt ait in france the union sindicale italiana in italy in the us workers solidarity alliance and the uk solidarity federation
the revolutionary industrial unionist industrial workers of the world claiming 2 000 paying members and the international workers association an anarcho syndicalist successor to the first international also remain active
anarchist schools of thought anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution
the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty i e opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill recognizing equality of entitlement
in a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical — those created throughout the 19th century — and post classical anarchist schools — those created since the mid 20th century and after
beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it
a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy
one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time
in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms i e collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought
classical anarchist schools of thought mutualism mutualism began in 18th century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states
proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organization emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order
it is important to recognize that proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance
for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service
mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform
according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount
mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism
proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property
individualist anarchism individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems
individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict
in 1793 william godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote political justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism
godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge
godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good
an influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the german max stirner
stirner s the ego and its own published in 1844 is a founding text of the philosophy
according to stirner the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for god state or morality
to stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality
stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which stirner proposed as a form of organization in place of the state
egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals
egoism has inspired many interpretations of stirner s philosophy
it was re discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and lgbt activist john henry mackay
josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during 1833 the peaceful revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published
for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster it is apparent that proudhon ian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews william b greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form
henry david thoreau 1817 – 1862 was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe
thoreau was an american author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading transcendentalist
he is best known for his books walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state
later benjamin tucker fused stirner s egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty
from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturist s nudist s see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clearical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france
these authors and activists included oscar wilde emile armand han ryner henri zisly renzo novatore miguel gimenez igualada adolf brand and lev chernyi among others
social anarchism social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations without any government authority or coercion
it is the largest school of thought in anarchism
social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid
collectivist anarchism collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most
collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised
this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production
however collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism
this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively uphold ing the wages system
collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society
anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a post revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need
anarcho communism anarchist communism also known as anarcho communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favor of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary association s and workers council s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need
some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom
most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society
anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international
the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro organizationalist and insurrectionary anti organizationalist sections
to date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society i e established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution
through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of aragon parts of the levante and andalusia as well as in the stronghold of anarchist catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war hitler mussolini spanish communist party repression backed by the ussr as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself
during the russian revolution anarchists such as nestor makhno worked to create and defend — through the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine — anarchist communism in the free territory of the ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the bolsheviks in 1921
anarcho syndicalism anarcho syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labor movement
anarcho syndicalists view labor unions as a potential force for revolution ary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self managed by workers
the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are workers solidarity direct action and workers self management anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action — that is action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position — will allow workers to liberate themselves
moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organizations the organizations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society should be self managing
they should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves
rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement
he outlined a view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet anarcho syndicalism
the international workers association is an international anarcho syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries
the spanish confederación nacional del trabajo played and still plays a major role in the spanish labor movement
it was also an important force in the spanish civil war
post classical schools of thought anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches
anarcha feminism developed as a synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism that views patriarchy male domination over women as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government
it was inspired by the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as lucy parsons emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre
anarcha feminists like other radical feminists criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family education and gender role s green anarchism or eco anarchism is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology
anarcho pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence
it developed mostly in the netherlands britain and the united states before and during the second world war
christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and christianity
its main proponents included leo tolstoy dorothy day ammon hennacy and jacques ellul
platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo truda s organizational platform of the general union of anarchists draft
the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the 1917 october revolution which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups
the platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement s failures during the russian revolution
synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchist organization that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives
in the 1920s this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists voline and sébastien faure
it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations
post left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism s relationship to traditional left wing politics
some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organizations and morality
influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international post left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation
insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice
it is critical of formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses
instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization and small affinity group based organization
insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies
post anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought drawing from diverse ideas including post modernism autonomist marxism post left anarchy situationism and postcolonialism
anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty in a free market
anarcho capitalism developed from radical anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from austrian school economics study of law and economics and public choice theory
there is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms
internal issues and debates anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought as such disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common
the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed
similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism and capitalism
anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines
phenomena such as civilization technology e g within anarcho primitivism and insurrectionary anarchism and the democratic process may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others
on a tactical level while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century e g the nihilist movement some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence counter economics and anti state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society
about the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones
the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory
topics of interest intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory
free love an important current within anarchism is free love
free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to josiah warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as a clear direct expression of an individual s self ownership
free love particularly stressed women s rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and anti birth control measures
the most important american free love journal was lucifer the lightbearer 1883 – 1907 edited by moses harman and lois waisbrooker but also there existed ezra heywood and angela heywood s the word 1872 – 1890 1892 – 1893
free society 1895 – 1897 as the firebrand 1897 – 1904 as free society was a major anarchist newspaper in the united states at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries
the publication advocated free love and women s rights and critiqued comstockery — censorship of sexual information
also m e lazarus was an important american individualist anarchist who promoted free love
in new york city s greenwich village bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self realisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now
they encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical edna st vincent millay and the lesbian anarchist margaret anderson were prominent among them
discussion groups organised by the villagers were frequented by emma goldman among others
magnus hirschfeld noted in 1923 that goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights
thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only american to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public
in fact before goldman heterosexual anarchist robert reitzel 1849 – 1898 spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his detroit based german language journal der arme teufel
in argentina anarcha feminist virginia bolten published the newspaper called which was published nine times in rosario between 8 january 1896 and 1 january 1897 and was revived briefly in 1901
in europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was emile armand
he proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults
he was also a consistent proponent of polyamory
in germany the stirner ists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality
mujeres libres was an anarchist women s organization in spain that aimed to empower working class women
it was founded in 1936 by lucía sánchez saornil mercedes comaposada and amparo poch y gascón and had approximately 30 000 members
the organization was based on the idea of a double struggle for women s liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel
in order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists
lucía sánchez saornil was a main founder of the spanish anarcha feminist federation mujeres libres who was open about her lesbian ism
she was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment
more recently the british anarcho pacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual the joy of sex
the issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho hedonist philosopher michel onfray in such works as théorie du corps amoureux pour une érotique solaire 2000 and l invention du plaisir fragments cyréaniques 2002
libertarian education and freethought for english anarchist william godwin education was the main means by which change would be achieved
godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness
for godwin education had to have a respect for the child s autonomy which precluded any form of coercion a pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child s own motivation and initiatives and a concern about the child s capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school
in his political justice he criticizes state sponsored schooling on account of its obvious alliance with national government
early american anarchist josiah warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established
max stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called the false principle of our education
in it stirner names his educational principle personalist explaining that self understanding consists in hourly self creation
education for him is to create free men sovereign characters by which he means eternal characters who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment
in the united states freethought was a basically anti christian anti clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters
a number of contributors to liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism
the individualist anarchist george macdonald was a co editor of freethought and for a time the truth seeker
e c walker was co editor of the excellent free thought free love journal lucifer the light bearer
many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as lucifer the light bearer freethought and the truth seeker appeared in liberty the church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself
in 1901 catalan anarchist and free thinker francesc ferrer i guàrdia established modern or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church
the schools stated goal was to educate the working class in a rational secular and non coercive setting
fiercely anti clerical ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state
murray bookchin wrote this period 1890s was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence
perhaps the best known effort in this field was francisco ferrer s modern school escuela moderna a project which exercised a considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally
la escuela moderna and ferrer s ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools in the united states cuba south america and london
the first of these was started in new york city in 1911
it also inspired the italian newspaper università popolare founded in 1901
russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate
tolstoy s educational experiments were short lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police
tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture
he thought that education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself education is culture under restraint culture is free
education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary
for him without compulsion education was transformed into culture
a more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child led activity replaces pedagogic approaches
experiments in germany led to a s neill founding what became summerhill school in 1921
summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice
however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach
in addition to organizing schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se
the term deschooling was popularized by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead
criticisms criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms

autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name
autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as the deficiency to point at things
three to five year old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others
however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers
most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than non autistic children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd
older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition
children with high functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone
making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism
for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel
functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply
there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd
the limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrum s a 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with asd and reported that about two thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one third had a history of aggression with tantrums significantly more common than in non autistic children with language impairments
a 2008 swedish study found that of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of asd those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis
communication about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs
differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver
in the second and third years autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words
autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns
joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience
autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language
in a pair of studies high functioning autistic children aged 8 – 15 performed equally well as and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling
both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference
as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends
repetitive behavior autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs r categorizes as follows
no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors
other symptoms autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family
an estimated 0 5 to 10 of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants
many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population
sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders
differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements
an estimated 60 – 80 of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper
unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator
selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition
although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal gi symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different gi symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between gi problems and asd is unclear
parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress
siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship
however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults
classification autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorder s pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior
these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance
of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder
unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development
the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism
in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably
asd in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact
the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments — who may be silent mentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rocking — to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication
because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary
sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial
autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound mental retardation or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis
although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome hfa and non syndromal autism is unclear
some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from 15 to 30 months of age
the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression
research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics
newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotype s observable traits that can be viewed on brain scan s to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects
it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior
causes it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms
however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur
autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutation s with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants
complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna but are heritable and influence gene expression
studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0 7 for autism and as high as 0 9 for asd and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population
however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified
typically autism can not be traced to a mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd
numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene
the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variation s — spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis
hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome
several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism
some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion
gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes
all known teratogen s agents that cause birth defect s related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development
although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies extensive searches are underway
environmental factor s that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism or may be important in future research include certain foods infectious disease heavy metals solvent s diesel exhaust pcbs phthalates and phenol s used in plastic products pesticide s brominated flame retardant s alcohol smoking illicit drug s vaccine s and prenatal stress although no links have been found and some have been completely disproven
parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination
this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the mmr vaccine for causing autism
the latter theory was supported by a litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud
although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children
mechanism autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain
how autism occurs is not well understood
its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors
the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies
pathophysiology unlike many other brain disorders such as parkinson s autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms
autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product
neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception
this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors
just after birth the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood
it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all autistic children
it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization
hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response
aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is possibly part of the mechanism of some forms of asd
although some abnormalities in the immune system have been found in specific subgroups of autistic individuals it is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to or secondary to autism s disease processes
as autoantibodies are found in conditions other than asd and are not always present in asd the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial
neurochemical systemsthe relationship of neurochemical s to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport
the role of group i metabotropic glutamate receptors mglur in the pathogenesis of fragile x syndrome the most common identified genetic cause of autism has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway
some data suggest an increase in several growth hormone s other data argue for diminished growth factor s also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than 5 of cases
brain systems mirror neuron system the mirror neuron system mns theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties
the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action
the mns may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions
several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger syndrome and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd
however individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object
asd related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks
default network and task positive network asd related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks
a 2008 brain imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in individuals with asd
a 2011 review states that evidence suggests that an entire network of brain regions involved in social and emotional processing the default network or default mode network dmn shows reduced functional connectivity
this indicates that the brain regions do not communicate in the same way that they would in a typical brain
two main hubs of the dmn the posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex appear to be hypoactive relative to neurotypical adults which may disrupt the functioning of the entire network
dysfunction in dmn connectivity is prominent in adolescents and young adults with autism suggesting that manifestation of dmn dysfunction may occur early in development
in contrast to the dysfunction in the dmn network intact connectivity has been observed in a “ central executive ” network that is involved in sustained attention cognitive control and goal directed thinking
in people with autism this network often called the task positive network and the dmn are not negatively correlated in time as found in typical adults suggesting a possible imbalance in switching between the two networks and possibly reflecting a disturbance of self referential thought
salience network the salience network sn is anchored in the anterior cingulate and the anterior insula
this network is thought to be involved in detecting integrating and filtering relevant interoceptive autonomic and emotional information to guide attention and action
the sn also includes two important subcortical structures the amygdala and the substantia nigra ventral tegmental area
these structures are thought to play a major role in detecting emotional and reward salience
both functional mri studies of social processing and mri studies that measure the size of brain regions have shown dysfunction of the sn in individuals with autism
one of the regions consistently showing significant hypoactivity in autism is the right anterior insula
dysfunction in this network may result in problems using internal body sensations to guide attention to salient social and other events with significant consequences for both cognition and self monitoring
recent studies demonstrate that in the typical brain the anterior insula provides an altering signal to initiate appropriate responses to salient stimuli
because the anterior insula is underactive during social processing in individuals with autism ineffective salience mapping of socially relevant cues may result in atypical social interactions
in contrast hyperactivity of the anterior insula has been consistently implicated in anxiety disorders
the anterior insula is proposed to play a key role in experiencing negative and worrisome thoughts as well as coordinating avoidance behaviors in individuals prone to anxiety
these are noteworthy findings because anxiety disorders are a common comorbid feature of many disorders including autism
therefore hyperactivity of the anterior insula or other nodes of the sn may lead to pathologically enhanced salience detection in some situations but not others
these findings may give explanation to many of the phenotypic or behavioral presentations of the disorder
for instance symptoms like stimulatory behavior increased anxiety or neuroticism may be consequence of the anterior insula misattributing emotional salience to mundane events
triple network model because the default mode network the salience network and the central executive networks appear to underlie prominent features of many major psychiatric and neurological disorders including autism schizophrenia adhd ad ftd depression and epilepsy a common framework was recently proposed for understanding dysfunction across disorders the triple network model
this model proposes that deficits in engaging and disengaging these networks play a significant role in many disorders including autism
by studying networks instead of specific brain regions it may be possible to gain new insights into understanding dysfunction across a number of disorders
a significant number of disorders have symptoms that overlap with autism spectrum disorders and autism spectrum diagnoses tend to be comorbid with other disorders
many individuals with autism may also be diagnosed with or show symptoms of depression anxiety and obsessive compulsive tendencies among others
the triple network model framework may help explain why these comorbidities occur and allow customized interventions
designing individualized interventions is important because autism manifests differently across individuals often varying from individual to individual
researchers focusing on the etiology of autism are beginning to recognize that symptoms can not be ascribed to the isolated operations of single brain areas
the triple network model reflects a shift from studying specific brain region to studying coordinated brain networks
while it may remain unclear what initially causes the disturbances in brain function that characterize autism understanding how they manifest in large scale network function may provide insights into predicting dysfunctional behavior patterns and designing appropriate interventions for autism as well as for a wide range of other psychopathologies
underconnectivity theory the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low level processes
evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex
other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex
stimulus processing in autismfrom studies based on event related potential s transient changes to the brain s electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli
for example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain s processing of auditory signals
autism and schizophreniain the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q21 1 deletion syndrome
research on autism schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 15q13 3 chromosome 16 16p13 1 and chromosome 17 17p12 are inconclusive
neuropsychology two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior
the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition
the empathizing – systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize — that is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain — but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents
an extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing this extension is controversial as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects
these theories are somewhat related to the earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others
the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children s atypical responses to the sally – anne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis
however most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people s basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints
the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the executive functions such as working memory planning inhibition
in his review kenworthy states that the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism
tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels
a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children
weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism
one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people
a related theory — enhanced perceptual functioning — focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals
these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism
neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties
a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful
screening about half of parents of children with asd notice their child s unusual behaviors by age 18 months and about four fifths notice by age 24 months
according to an article in the journal of autism and developmental disorders failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations
delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome
us and japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at 18 and 24 months using autism specific formal screening tests
in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened
it is not known which approach is more effective
screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers m chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on m chat and its predecessor chat on children aged 18 – 30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives
it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders
screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture
although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic feature s diagnosis diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism
autism is defined in the dsm iv tr as exhibiting at least six symptoms total including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior
sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
onset must be prior to age three years with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or imaginative play
the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome or childhood disintegrative disorder
icd 10 uses essentially the same definition
several diagnostic instruments are available
two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi r is a semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child
the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children
a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child
if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions
a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions
a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider mental retardation hearing impairment and a specific language impairment such as landau – kleffner syndrome
the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression
clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause
although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40 of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile x testing
a genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations
as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge
commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism s genetics
metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine
asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later
in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice
a 2009 us study found the average age of formal asd diagnosis was 5 7 years far above recommendations and that 27 of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years
although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits
underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices
the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms
conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis
it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindism s management the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence
no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs
families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment
studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy
although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic review s of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options
intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care social and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated
available approaches include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy
educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children
neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided
it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results
the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers
many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails
more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drug s or anticonvulsant s with the most common drug classes being antidepressant s stimulant s and antipsychotic s aside from antipsychotics there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd
a person with asd may respond atypically to medications the medications can have adverse effects and no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments
experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism
although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies
treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance
scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests
some alternative treatments may place the child at risk
a 2008 study found that compared to their peers autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein free diet s in 2005 botched chelation therapy killed a five year old child with autism
treatment is expensive indirect costs are more so
for someone born in 2000 a us study estimated an average lifetime cost of net present value in dollars inflation adjusted from 2003 estimate with about 10 medical care 30 extra education and other care and 60 lost economic productivity
publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child and unreimbursed out of pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems one 2008 us study found a 14 average loss of annual income in families of children with asd and a related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment
us states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance
after childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning
prognosis there is no known cure
children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not
it is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from 3 to 25
most autistic children can acquire language by age 5 or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years
most children with autism lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or self determination
although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age
few high quality studies address long term prognosis
some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife
acquiring language before age six having an iq above 50 and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism
a 2004 british study of 68 adults who were diagnosed before 1980 as autistic children with iq above 50 found that 12 achieved a high level of independence as adults 10 had some friends and were generally in work but required some support 19 had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living 46 needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in asd with a high level of support and very limited autonomy and 12 needed high level hospital care
a 2005 swedish study of 78 adults that did not exclude low iq found worse prognosis for example only 4 achieved independence
a 2008 canadian study of 48 young adults diagnosed with asd as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor 46 fair 32 good 17 and very good 4 56 of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives mostly in volunteer sheltered or part time work
changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children
epidemiology most recent review s tend to estimate a prevalence of 1 – 2 per 1 000 for autism and close to 6 per 1 000 for asd and 11 per 1 000 children in the united states for asd as of 2008 because of inadequate data these numbers may underestimate asd s true prevalence
pdd nos s prevalence has been estimated at 3 7 per 1 000 asperger syndrome at roughly 0 6 per 1 000 and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0 02 per 1 000
the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s
this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors can not be ruled out
the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics
boys are at higher risk for asd than girls
the sex ratio averages 4 3 1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to 2 1 with mental retardation and more than 5 5 1 without
although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy
the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism
most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism
several other conditions are common in children with autism
they include history a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named
the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of a 12 year old boy who may have been severely autistic
luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report
the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair s marriage to gain blair s inheritance
the wild boy of aveyron a feral child caught in 1798 showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation
the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia
he derived it from the greek word autós αὐτός meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance
the word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology
asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981
leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities
almost all the characteristics described in kanner s first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders
it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger
kanner s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to refrigerator mother s
starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy
as late as the mid 1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions
although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have deeply affected how we view asd parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their autistic children s behaviors are perceived negatively by others and many primary care physician s and medical specialist s still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research
the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely
sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being

albedo or reflection coefficient derived from latin albedo whiteness or reflected sunlight in turn from albus white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface
it is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it
being a dimensionless fraction it may also be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface
albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation
when quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light
in general the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation
exceptions are lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution
in practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately although the albedo is a very useful first approximation
the albedo is an important concept in climatology and astronomy as well as in calculating reflectivity of surfaces in leed sustainable rating systems for buildings
the average overall albedo of earth its planetary albedo is 30 to 35 because of the covering by clouds but varies widely locally across the surface depending on the geological and environmental features
the term was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometria
terrestrial albedo albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0 9 for fresh snow to about 0 04 for charcoal one of the darkest substances
deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body
when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms
most land areas are in an albedo range of 0 1 to 0 4
the average albedo of the earth is about 0 3
this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds
human activities have changed the albedo via forest clearance and farming for example of various areas around the globe
however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult
the classic example of albedo effect is the snow temperature feedback
if a snow covered area warms and the snow melts the albedo decreases more sunlight is absorbed and the temperature tends to increase
the converse is also true if snow forms a cooling cycle happens
the intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics
the earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa s modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites
as the total amount of reflected radiation can not be directly measured by satellite a mathematical model of the brdf is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e g
the earth s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 ° c if the earth was frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below − 40 ° c if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 ° c in contrast if all the ice on earth were to melt — a so called aquaplanet — the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 ° c white sky and black sky albedo it has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle and the bi hemispherical reflectance bar the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination
albedo can then be given as directional hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and bi hemispherical reflectance as white sky albedo
these terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface
astronomical albedo the albedos of planet s satellites and asteroid s can be used to infer much about their properties
the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry
for small and far objects that can not be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos
for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in asteroid s enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with 99 of em radiation reflected
another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of 0 96
many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0 05
a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0 04
such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compound s the overall albedo of the moon is around 0 12 but it is strongly directional and non lambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect
while such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies
two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the v band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected
their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion
in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces
the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is a left frac right 2 where a is the astronomical albedo d is the diameter in kilometers and h is the absolute magnitude
examples of terrestrial albedo effects illumination although the albedo – temperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year round illumination is greater
the maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between 3 and 12 degrees north
the minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination
small scale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too
in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing
trees because forests are generally attributed a low albedo as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo
through the evapotranspiration of water trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy
this water vapour rises resulting in cloud cover which also has a high albedo thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forests
in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 to 50 higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily
deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0 15 to 0 18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0 09 to 0 15
studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests
they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g siberia were neutral or perhaps warming
snow snow albedos can be as high as 0 9 this however is for the ideal example fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape
over antarctica they average a little more than 0 8
if a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt the ice albedo positive feedback
cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets
water water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials
the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations see graph
at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely
the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this
at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs
incident angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle
although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles
however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction
since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light
note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities
fresh ‘ black ’ ice exhibits fresnel reflection
clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures
different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0 8
on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water
clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth
albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrail s of heavy commercial airliner traffic
a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 ° c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies
aerosol effects aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on the earth ’s radiative balance
the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain
as per the effects are black carbon another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles
the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is 0 2 w m − 2 with a range 0 1 to 0 4 w m − 2
other types of albedo single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles
it depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle or particles and the wavelength of the incoming radiation

a named a plural aes is the first letter and vowel in the iso basic latin alphabet
it is similar to the ancient greek letter alpha from which it derives
origins the earliest certain ancestor of a is aleph also called aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which by consisting entirely of consonant s is an abjad rather than a true alphabet
in turn the origin of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyph s styled as a triangular head with two horns extended
in 1600 b c e the phoenician alphabet s letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms
its name must have corresponded closely to the hebrew or arabic aleph
when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for the glottal stop — the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter and the sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages — so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel and gave it the similar name of alpha
in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the 8th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set
the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged
the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet used to write many languages including english
during roman times there were many variations on the letter a
first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent mediums
for perishable surfaces what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes a cursive style was used
due to the perishable nature of the surfaces these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental
this perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive semicursive minuscule
there were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive
the known variants include the early semiuncial the uncial and the later semiuncial
at the termination of the roman empire 5th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule appeared through western europe
among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semiuncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain
by the 9th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press
this form was derived through a combining of prior forms
15th century italy saw the formation of the two variants that are known today
these variants the italics and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version
the italics form used in most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke called latin alpha or script a
this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of dark age irish and english writers
most printed material uses the roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it
both derive from the majuscule capital form
in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown
many fonts then made the right leg vertical
in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form
use in english in english the letter a currently represents six different vowel sounds a by itself frequently denotes the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father its original latin and greek sound a closer further fronted sound as in hare which developed as the sound progressed from father to ace in concert with a later orthographic vowel the diphthong as in ace and major due to effects of the great vowel shift the more rounded form in water or its closely related cousin found in was
the double a sequence is not a native english combination however it is used this way in some foreign words such as aaron and aardvark
a is the third most commonly used letter in english after e and t and the second most common in spanish and french
in one study on average about 3 68 of letters used in english tend to be a while the number is 6 22 in spanish and 3 95 in french
a is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status a a or a the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork a grade for clean restaurants a list celebrities etc
such associations can have a motivating effect as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance when compared with other letters
the letter a along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet are used in algebra to represent known quantities
whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet x y z are used to denote unknown quantities
also in geometry the capital a b c etc are used to denote segment s line s ray s etc
also a is typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle
in logic a is used to signify the universal affirmative
finally the letter a is used to denote sized as in a narrow size shoe or a small cup size in a brassiere
use in other languages in most languages that use the latin alphabet a denotes an open unrounded vowel or
an exception is saanich in which a and á stand for a close mid front unrounded vowel
in the variants of a denote various vowel s in x sampa capital a denotes the open back unrounded vowel and lowercase a denotes the open front unrounded vowel

alabama is a state located in the southeastern region of the united states
it is bordered by tennessee to the north georgia to the east florida and the gulf of mexico to the south and mississippi to the west
alabama is the 30th most extensive and the 23rd most populous of the 50 united states
at alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation
from the american civil war until world war ii alabama like many southern states suffered economic hardship in part because of continued dependence on agriculture
despite the growth of major industries and urban centers white rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s while urban interests and african americans were under represented
following world war ii alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests
the establishment or expansion of multiple united states armed forces installations added to the state economy and helped bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid 20th century
the state economy in the 21st century is dependent on management automotive finance manufacturing aerospace mineral extraction healthcare education retail and technology
alabama is unofficially nicknamed the yellowhammer state after the state bird
alabama is also known as the heart of dixie
the state tree is the longleaf pine the state flower is the camellia
the capital of alabama is montgomery
the largest city by population is birmingham
the largest city by total land area is huntsville
the oldest city is mobile founded by french colonists
history etymology the alabama people a muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa river s on the upper reaches of the alabama river served as the etymological source of the names of the river and state
in the alabama language the word for an alabama person is albaamo or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects the plural form alabama persons is albaamaha
the word alabama is believed to have originated from the choctaw language and was later adopted by the alabama tribe as their name
the spelling of the word varies significantly between sources
the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of 1540 with garcilasso de la vega using alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively
as early as 1702 the tribe was known to the french as alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivière des alibamons
other spellings of the appellation have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu and allibamou
although the origin of alabama could be discerned sources disagree on its meaning
an 1842 article in the jacksonville republican originated the idea that the meaning was here we rest
this notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek
experts in the muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation
scholars believe the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather
the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers which may refer to clearing of land for cultivation or to collecting medicinal plants
alabama is but one of many place names in the state of native american origin
pre european settlement indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before european colonization
trade with the northeast via the ohio river began during the burial mound period 1000 bc – ad 700 and continued until european contact
the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from ad 1000 to 1600 with one of its major centers being at the moundville archaeological site in moundville alabama
analysis of artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex secc
contrary to popular belief the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerica n culture but developed independently
the ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood
among the historical tribes of native american people living in the area of present day alabama at the time of european contact were iroquoian speaking cherokee and the muskogean speaking alabama alibamu chickasaw choctaw creek and koasati
european settlement the french founded the first european settlement in the region at old mobile in 1702
the city was moved to the current site of mobile in 1711
this area was french from 1702 to 1763 part of british west florida from 1763 to 1783 and split between the united states and spain from 1783 to 1821
thomas bassett a loyalist to the british monarchy was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside of the mobile area
he settled in the tombigbee settlements in what is now washington county during the early 1770s
what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in 1783 part of the independent republic of west florida in 1810 and was finally added to the mississippi territory in 1812
the area making up today s northern and central alabama and mississippi then known as the yazoo lands had been claimed by the province of georgia after 1767
following the revolutionary war it remained a part of georgia although heavily disputed
with the exception of the immediate area around mobile and the yazoo lands what is now central alabama was made part of the mississippi territory upon its creation in 1798
the yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804 following the yazoo land scandal
spain had kept a governmental presence in mobile after 1812
when andrew jackson s forces occupied mobile in 1814 he demonstrated the united states de facto authority over the region which effectively ended spanish influence although not its claim while gaining an unencumbered passage to the gulf of mexico from the hinterlands of the territory
prior to the admission of mississippi as a state on december 10 1817 the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory
the alabama territory was created by the united states congress on march 3 1817
st stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819
early statehood the u s congress selected huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention of alabama after it was approved to become the 22nd state
from july 5 to august 2 1819 delegates met to prepare the new state constitution
huntsville served as the temporary capital of alabama from 1819 to 1820 when the seat of state government was moved to cahaba in dallas county
cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825
alabama fever was already underway when the state was admitted to the union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation
part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men
southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded
the economy of the central black belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew largely from slave labor
the area also drew many poor disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers
alabama had a population estimated at under 10 000 people in 1810 but it had increased to more than 300 000 people by 1830
most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in 1830
from 1826 to 1846 tuscaloosa served as the capital of alabama
on january 30 1846 the alabama legislature announced that it had voted to remove the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery
the first legislative session in the new capital met in december 1847
a new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia
the first structure burned down in 1849 but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851
this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day
it was designed by barachias holt of exeter maine
by 1860 the population had increased to a total of 964 201 people of which 435 080 were enslaved african americans and 2 690 were free people of color
civil war and reconstruction on january 11 1861 alabama declared its secession from the union
after remaining an independent republic for a few days it joined the confederate states of america
the confederacy s capital was initially located at montgomery
although comparatively few battles were fought in the state alabama contributed about 120 000 soldiers to the american civil war
alabama s slaves were freed by the 13th amendment in 1865
a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrest s battalion in hopkinsville kentucky
the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails
this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army
alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may 1865 until its official restoration to the union in 1868
from 1867 to 1874 with most white citizens barred from voting many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state
alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african american congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin s turner and james t rapier
following the war the state was remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton
during reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 that created a public school system for the first time and expanded women s rights
legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation
organized resistance groups also tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans
besides the short lived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league
reconstruction in alabama ended in 1874 when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor s office
they wrote another constitution in 1875 and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools
the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools
railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891
more jim crow laws were passed at the beginning of the 20th century to enforce segregation in everyday life
1900 – 1949 the new 1901 constitution of alabama included electoral laws that effectively disfranchised african americans and most poor whites through voting restrictions including poll taxes and literacy requirements
while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to support these legislative efforts the new restrictions resulted in their disfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax
in 1900 alabama had more than 181 000 african americans eligible to vote
by 1903 only 2 980 had qualified to register although at least 74 000 black voters were literate
by 1941 more white alabamians than black had been disfranchised 600 000 whites to 520 000 blacks
nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote
the 1901 constitution reiterated that schools be racially segregated
it also restated that interracial marriage was illegal although it had already been against the law since 1867
further racial segregation laws were passed into the 1950s jails in 1911 hospitals in 1915 toilets hotels and restaurants in 1928 and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945
the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes
partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the building of what came to be known as rosenwald school s in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs
the local community and state paid the rest
beginning in 1913 the first 80 rosenwald schools were built in alabama
a total of 387 schools 7 teacher s houses and several vocational buildings had been completed in the state by 1937
several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places
continued racial discrimination agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans to seek opportunities in northern cities
they left alabama in the early 20th century as part of the great migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities
the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920 reflecting this emigration
at the same time many rural whites and blacks moved to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs
birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the magic city
by the 1920s birmingham was the 19th largest city in the united states and had more than 30 of the alabama s population
heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy
industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity not seen since before the civil war
rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living
one example of this massive influx of workers can be shown by what happened in mobile
between 1940 and 1943 more than 89 000 people moved into the city to work for war effort industries
cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base
1950 – 2000 despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population
they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas
in addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside birmingham
one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham s industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services
urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature
a 1960 study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature
african americans were presumed partial to republicans for historical reasons but they were disfranchised
white alabamans felt bitter towards the republican party in the aftermath of the civil war and reconstruction
these factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a democrat regardless of political beliefs
although efforts had already started decades earlier african americans began to more actively attempt to end the disfranchisement and segregation in the state during the 1950s and 1960s with the civil rights movement
these efforts directly led to the enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 by the u s congress
during the 1960s under governor george wallace failed attempts were made at the state level to resist federally sanctioned desegregation efforts
during the civil rights movement african americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965
legal segregation ended in the states as jim crow laws were invalidated or repealed
under the voting rights act of 1965 cases were filed in federal courts to force alabama to redistrict by population both the house and senate of the state legislature
in 1972 for the first time since 1901 the legislature implemented the alabama constitution s provision for periodic redistricting based on population
this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years

instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning

alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol
however counties can declare themselves dry the state does not sell alcohol in those areas
politics during reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope
in 1874 the political coalition known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the african american vote
after 1890 a coalition of whites passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise black residents a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution
provisions which disfranchised african americans also disfranchised poor whites however
by 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised 600 000 to 520 000 although the impact was greater on the african american community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised
from 1901 through the 1960s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state
the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972
alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the american civil rights movement when majority whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform
democrat george wallace the state s only four term governor was a controversial figure
only with the passage of the federal civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 did african americans regain suffrage among other civil rights
in 2007 the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact
in a symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol which housed congress of the confederate states of america
in 2010 republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years
elections state electionswith the disfranchisement of african americans the state became part of the solid south a system in which the democratic party became essentially the only political party in every southern state
for nearly 100 years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election
republicans hold all nine seats on the alabama supreme court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts
until 1994 no republicans held any of the court seats
this change also began likely in part due to the same perception by voters of democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in 1994
in that general election the then incumbent chief justice of alabama ernest c hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3 000 votes to republican perry o hooper sr
hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court
this ultimately led to a collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles
the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 2011 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench
republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices
republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education
in 2010 republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years
democrats hold one of the three seats on the alabama public service commission
only two republican lieutenant governors have been elected since reconstruction one is kay ivey the current lieutenant governor
local electionsmany local offices county commissioners boards of education tax assessors tax collectors etc in the state are still held by democrats
local elections in most rural counties are generally decided in the democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan and suburban counties are generally decided in the republican primary although there are exceptions
alabama s 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan races and democrats still retain the majority of those posts
the current split is 42 democrats 24 republicans and one independent choctaw
however most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties and the majority of republican sheriffs preside over more urban suburban and heavily populated counties
two alabama counties montgomery and calhoun with a population of over 100 000 have democratic sheriffs and five alabama counties with a population of under 75 000 have republican sheriffs autauga coffee dale coosa and blount
as of 2012 the state of alabama has one female sheriff in morgan county alabama and nine african american sheriffs
federal electionsthe state s two u s senators are jefferson b sessions iii and richard c shelby both republicans

in greek mythology achilles akhilleus was a greek hero of the trojan war and the central character and greatest warrior of homer s iliad
achilles was said to be a demigod his mother was the nymph thetis and his father peleus was the king of the myrmidons
achilles ’ most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan hero hector outside the gates of troy
although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris who shot him in the heel with an arrow
later legends beginning with a poem by statius in the 1st century ad state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel
because of his death from a small wound in the heel the term achilles heel has come to mean a person s point of weakness
etymology achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of akhos grief and laos a people tribe nation etc in other words achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people grief being a theme raised numerous times in the iliad frequently by achilles
achilles role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of achilles as the hero of kleos glory usually glory in war
laos has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster
with this derivation the name would have a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring grief to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war
the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership
the name achilleus was a common and attested name among the greeks soon after the 7th century bc
it was also turned into the female form ἀχιλλεία achilleía attested in attica in the 4th century bc ig ii ² 1617 and in the form achillia on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an amazon
roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology and this seems to reference achilles fight with penthesilea but gives it an extra twist of achilles being played by a woman
birth achilles was the son of the nymph thetis and peleus the king of the myrmidons
zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus the fore thinker warned zeus of a prophecy that thetis would bear a son greater than his father
for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleus
as with most mythology there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in argonautica iv 760 zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus that thetis was so loyal to hera s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him
thetis although a daughter of the sea god nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus
according to the achilleid written by statius in the 1st century ad and to no surviving previous sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx
however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his heel see achilles heel achilles tendon
it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier
in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body
she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage
however none of the sources before statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability
to the contrary in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded in book 21 the paeonian hero asteropaeus son of pelagon challenged achilles by the river scamander
he cast two spears at once one grazed achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood
also in the fragmentary poems of the epic cycle in which we can find description of the hero s death cypria unknown author aithiopis by arctinus of miletus little iliad by lesche of mytilene iliou persis by arctinus of miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness heel in the later vase paintings presenting achilles death the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his body
peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur on mt pelion to be reared
achilles in the trojan war the first two lines of the iliad read achilles consuming rage is at times wavering but at other times he can not be cooled
the humanization of achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative
according to the iliad achilles arrived at troy with 50 ships each carrying 50 myrmidons book 2
he appointed five leaders each leader commanding 500 myrmidons menesthius eudorus peisander phoenix and alcimedon book 16
telephus when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus
in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal
guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy
according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound
achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge
alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound
odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it
pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed
troilus according to the cypria the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles wrath when the achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighboring cities and killed troilus
according to dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe troilus was a young trojan prince the youngest of king priam s or sometimes apollo and hecuba s five legitimate sons
despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders
prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him
yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who refusing to yield found instead himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of apollo
later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace
in this version of the myth achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege
ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents
had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible
achilles in the iliad homer s iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war
achilles wrath is the central theme of the book
the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war and does not narrate achilles death
it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces
agamemnon had taken a woman named chryseis as his slave
her father chryses a priest of apollo begged agamemnon to return her to him
agamemnon refused and apollo sent a plague amongst the greeks
the prophet calchas correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless achilles vowed to protect him
achilles did so and calchas declared chryseis must be returned to her father
agamemnon consented but then commanded that achilles battle prize briseis be brought to replace chryseis
angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loved briseis with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refused to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces
at this same time burning with rage over agamemnon s theft achilles prayed to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honor
as the battle turned against the greeks thanks to the influence of zeus nestor declared that the trojans were winning because agamemnon had angered achilles and urged the king to appease the warrior
agamemnon agreed and sent odysseus and two other chieftains ajax and phoenix to achilles with the offer of the return of briseis and other gifts
achilles rejected all agamemnon offered him and simply urged the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do
the trojans led by hector subsequently pushed the greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the greek ships
with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction patroclus led the myrmidons into battle wearing achilles armor though achilles remained at his camp
patroclus succeeded in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but was killed by hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of troy
after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieved over his beloved companion s death and held many funeral games in his honor
his mother thetis came to comfort the distraught achilles
she persuaded hephaestus to make a new armor for him in place of the armor that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector
the new armor included the shield of achilles described in great detail by the poet
enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector
achilles even engaged in battle with the river god scamander who became angry that achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed
the god tried to drown achilles but was stopped by hera and hephaestus
zeus himself took note of achilles rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack troy itself seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles could defy fate itself as troy was not meant to be destroyed yet
finally achilles found his prey
achilles chased hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hector s favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuaded hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face
after hector realized the trick he knew the battle was inevitable
wanting to go down fighting he charged at achilles with his only weapon his sword but missed
accepting his fate hector begged achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him
achilles told hector it was hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me
achilles then got his vengeance
with the assistance of the god hermes hector s father priam went to achilles tent to plead with achilles to permit him to perform for hector his funeral rites
achilles relented and promised a truce for the duration of hector s funeral
the final passage in the iliad is hector s funeral after which the doom of troy was just a matter of time
penthesilea achilles after his temporary truce with priam fought and killed the amazonian warrior queen penthesilea but later grieved over her death
at first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual
once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her
as he grieved over the death of such a rare beauty a notorious greek jeerer by the name of thersites laughed and mocked the great achilles
memnon and the fall of achilles following the death of patroclus achilles closest companion was nestor s son antilochus
when memnon king of ethiopia slew antilochus achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield killing memnon
the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon unlike hector was also the son of a goddess
many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliads description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it
the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the 7th century b c
the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors
the death of achilles as predicted by hector with his dying breath was brought about by paris with an arrow to the heel according to statius
in some versions the god apollo guided paris arrow
some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow
all of these versions deny paris any sort of valor owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield
his bones were mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games were held
he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube
another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena
achilles asks priam for polyxena s hand in marriage
priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world s greatest warrior
but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow killing him
achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus
paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles
fate of achilles armor achilles armor was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ajax the greater
they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of odysseus
furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned the ire of athena
athena temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades
after a while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide
odysseus eventually gave the armor to neoptolemus the son of achilles
a relic claimed to be achilles bronze headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia a port on the pamphylian gulf
the city was visited in 333 bc by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear which he would indeed have touched with excitement
but it was being shown in the time of pausanias in the 2nd century ad
achilles and patroclus the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times
in the iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship but commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures
in 5th century bc athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia
in plato s symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover
but ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women
although epic decorum excluded explicit sexuality the iliad indicates that achilles had sexual relations with women with no direct evidence of sexual behaviors with patroclus
worship of achilles in antiquity there was an archaic heroic cult of achilles on the white island leuce in the black sea off the modern coasts of romania and ukraine with a temple and an oracle which survived into the roman period
in the lost epic aithiopis a continuation of the iliad attributed to arktinus of miletos achilles ’ mother thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to leuce at the mouths of the danube
there the achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games
pliny s natural history mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident insula akchillis tumulo eius viri clara on the island consecrated to him located at a distance of fifty roman miles from peuce by the danube delta and the temple there
pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame
in this island there is also achilles ’ temple and his statue
ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in 1823 but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island
pomponius mela tells that achilles is buried in the island named achillea between boristhene and ister
the greek geographer dionysius periegetus of bithynia who lived at the time of domitian writes that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white
it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor
the periplus of the euxine sea gives the following details it is said that the goddess thetis raised this island from the sea for her son achilles who dwells there
here is his temple and his statue an archaic work
this island is not inhabited and goats graze on it not many which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships sacrifice to achilles
in this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts craters rings and precious stones offered to achilles in gratitude
one can still read inscriptions in greek and latin in which achilles is praised and celebrated
some of these are worded in patroclus ’ honor because those who wish to be favored by achilles honor patroclus at the same time
there are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds which look after achilles ’ temple
every morning they fly out to sea wet their wings with water and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it
and after they finish the sprinkling they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings
other people say still more that some of the men who reach this island come here intentionally
they bring animals in their ships destined to be sacrificed
some of these animals they slaughter others they set free on the island in achilles ’ honor
but there are others who are forced to come to this island by sea storms
as they have no sacrificial animals but wish to get them from the god of the island himself they consult achilles ’ oracle
they ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair
but in case the oracle denies them permission because there is an oracle here they add something to the price offered and if the oracle refuses again they add something more until at last the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient
and then the victim does n’t run away any more but waits willingly to be caught
so there is a great quantity of silver there consecrated to the hero as price for the sacrificial victims
to some of the people who come to this island achilles appears in dreams to others he would appear even during their navigation if they were not too far away and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships
quoted in densuşianu the heroic cult of achilles on leuce island was widespread in antiquity not only along the sea lanes of the pontic sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the black sea
achilles from leuce island was venerated as pontarches the lord and master of the pontic sea the protector of sailors and navigation
sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice
to achilles of leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters achilleion in messenia stephanus byzantinus achilleios in laconia pausanias iii 25 4 nicolae densuşianu densuşianu 1913 even though he recognized achilles in the name of aquileia and in the north arm of the danube delta the arm of chilia achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over pontos evokes modern rather than archaic sea law
leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing
pausanias iii 19 13 reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound
ammianus marcellinus xxii 8 attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island
worship of achilles in modern times the achilleion in corfu in the region of gastouri γαστούρι to the south of the city of corfu greece empress of austria elisabeth of bavaria also known as sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to platonic romanticism
the palace naturally was named after achilles achilleion αχίλλειον
this elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the trojan war
other stories some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hides the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros
there achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha the red haired girl
with lycomedes daughter deidamia whom in the account of statius he rapes achilles there fathers a son neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his father s possible alias
according to this story odysseus learns from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid
odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women s clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods
when achilles instantly takes up the spear odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the greek campaign
in another version of the story odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women flee in panic achilles prepares to defend the court thus giving his identity away
in book 11 of homer s odyssey odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades
one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead
but achilles then asks odysseus of his son s exploits in the trojan war and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus heroic actions achilles is filled with satisfaction
this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life
achilles was worshipped as a sea god in many of the greek colonies on the black sea the location of the mythical white island which he was said to inhabit after his death together with many other heroes
the kings of the epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus
alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor
he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy
in ad 216 the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus
achilles fought and killed the amazon helene
some also said he married medea and that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades – as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica
in some versions of the myth achilles has a relationship with his captive briseis
achilles in greek tragedy the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars
the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel
extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play
the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only a few lines survive today
in plato s symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him
the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles a play with achilles as the main character
only a few fragments survive
achilles in greek philosophy the philosopher zeno of elea centered one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift footed achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible
as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions

abraham lincoln february 12 1809 – april 15 1865 was the 16th president of the united states serving from march 1861 until his assassination in april 1865
lincoln led the united states through its greatest constitutional military and moral crises — the american civil war — preserving the union abolishing slavery strengthening the national government and modernizing the economy
reared in a poor family on the western frontier lincoln was self educated and became a country lawyer a whig party leader illinois state legislator during the 1830s and a one term member of the united states house of representatives during the 1840s
after a series of debates in 1858 that gave national visibility to his opposition to the expansion of slavery lincoln lost a senate race to his arch rival stephen a douglas
lincoln a moderate from a swing state secured the republican party presidential nomination in 1860
with almost no support in the south lincoln swept the north and was elected president in 1860
his election was the signal for seven southern slave states to declare their secession from the union and form the confederacy
the departure of the southerners gave lincoln s party firm control of congress but no formula for compromise or reconciliation was found
lincoln explained in his second inaugural address both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came
when the north enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the confederate attack on fort sumter on april 12 1861 lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort
his goal was now to reunite the nation
as the south was in a state of insurrection lincoln exercised his authority to suspend habeas corpus arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists without trial
lincoln averted british recognition of the confederacy by skillfully handling the trent affair in late 1861
his efforts toward the abolition of slavery include issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery and helping push through congress the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution which finally freed all slaves nationwide in december 1865
lincoln closely supervised the war effort especially the selection of top generals including commanding general ulysses s grant
lincoln brought leaders of the major factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate
under lincoln s leadership the union set up a naval blockade that shut down the south s normal trade took control of the border slave states at the start of the war gained control of communications with gunboats on the southern river systems and tried repeatedly to capture the confederate capital at richmond virginia
each time a general failed lincoln substituted another until finally grant succeeded in 1865
an exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state lincoln reached out to war democrats and managed his own re election in the 1864 presidential election
as the leader of the moderate faction of the republican party lincoln found his policies and personality were blasted from all sides radical republicans demanded harsher treatment of the south war democrats desired more compromise copperheads despised him and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death
politically lincoln fought back with patronage by pitting his opponents against each other and by appealing to the american people with his powers of oratory
his gettysburg address of 1863 became the most quoted speech in american history
it was an iconic statement of america s dedication to the principles of nationalism republicanism equal rights liberty and democracy
at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness
six days after the surrender of confederate commanding general robert e lee however lincoln was assassinated by actor and confederate sympathizer john wilkes booth
lincoln s death was the first assassination of a u s president and sent the nation into mourning
lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the greatest u s presidents
family and childhood early life abraham lincoln was born february 12 1809 the second child of thomas lincoln and nancy lincoln née hanks in a one room log cabin on the sinking spring farm in hardin county kentucky now larue county
he is descended from samuel lincoln who arrived in hingham massachusetts from norfolk england in the 17th century
lincoln s paternal grandfather and namesake abraham had moved his family from virginia to kentucky where he was ambushed and killed in an indian raid in 1786 with his children including lincoln s father thomas looking on
thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier
lincoln s mother nancy was the daughter of lucy hanks and was born in what is now mineral county west virginia then part of virginia
lucy moved with nancy to kentucky
nancy hanks married thomas who became a respected citizen
he bought and sold several farms including knob creek farm
the family attended a separate baptists church which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol dancing and slavery
thomas enjoyed considerable status in kentucky — where he sat on juries appraised estates served on country slave patrols and guarded prisoners
by the time his son abraham was born thomas owned two farms several town lots livestock and horses
he was among the richest men in the county
however in 1816 thomas lost all of his land in court cases because of faulty property titles
the family moved north across the ohio river to free i e non slave territory and made a new start in what was then perry county but is now spencer county indiana
lincoln later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery but mainly due to land title difficulties
in indiana when lincoln was nine his mother nancy died of milk sickness in 1818
after the death of lincoln s mother his older sister sarah took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819 sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a stillborn son
thomas lincoln s new wife was the widow sarah bush johnston the mother of three children
lincoln became very close to his stepmother and referred to her as mother
as a pre teen he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life
some in his family and in the neighborhood for a time considered him to be lazy
as he grew into his teens he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences
he attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians the clary s grove boys
lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21
in later years lincoln occasionally loaned his father money
lincoln became increasingly distant from his father in part because of his father s lack of education
while young lincoln s formal education consisted approximately of a year s worth of classes from several itinerant teachers he was mostly self educated and was an avid reader and often sought access to any new books in the village
he read and reread the king james bible aesop s fables bunyan s pilgrim s progress defoe s robinson crusoe and franklin s autobiography
in 1830 fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the ohio river the lincoln family moved west where they settled on public land in macon county illinois another free non slave state
in 1831 thomas relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois
it was then that as an ambitious 22 year old who was now old enough to make his own decisions lincoln struck out on his own
canoeing down the sangamon river lincoln ended up in the village of new salem in sangamon county
in the spring of 1831 hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods by flatboat from new salem to new orleans via the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers
after arriving in new orleans — and witnessing slavery firsthand — he walked back home
marriage and children lincoln s first romantic interest was ann rutledge whom he met when he first moved to new salem by 1835 they were in a relationship but not formally engaged
she died at the age of 22 on august 25 1835 most likely of typhoid fever
in the early 1830s he met mary owens from kentucky when she was visiting her sister
late in 1836 lincoln agreed to a match with mary if she returned to new salem
mary did return in november 1836 and lincoln courted her for a time however they both had second thoughts about their relationship
on august 16 1837 lincoln wrote mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship
she never replied and the courtship ended
in 1840 lincoln became engaged to mary todd who was from a wealthy slave holding family in lexington kentucky
they met in springfield illinois in december 1839 and were engaged the following december
a wedding set for january 1 1841 was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at lincoln s initiative
they later met again at a party and married on november 4 1842 in the springfield mansion of mary s married sister
while preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again lincoln when asked where he was going replied to hell i suppose
in 1844 the couple bought a house in springfield near lincoln s law office
mary todd lincoln kept house often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl
robert todd lincoln was born in 1843 and edward baker lincoln eddie in 1846
lincoln was remarkably fond of children and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children
edward died on february 1 1850 in springfield probably of tuberculosis
willie lincoln was born on december 21 1850 and died on february 20 1862
the lincolns fourth son thomas tad lincoln was born on april 4 1853 and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on july 16 1871
robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children
his last descendant grandson robert todd lincoln beckwith died in 1985
the deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents
later in life mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons and robert lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875
abraham lincoln suffered from melancholy a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression
lincoln s father in law was based in lexington kentucky he and others of the todd family were either slave owners or slave traders
lincoln was close to the todds and he and his family occasionally visited the todd estate in lexington
he was an affectionate though often absent husband and father of four children
early career and militia service in 1832 at age 23 lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in new salem illinois
although the economy was booming in the region the business struggled and lincoln eventually sold his share
that march he began his political career with his first campaign for the illinois general assembly
he had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in new salem though he lacked an education powerful friends and money which may be why he lost
he advocated navigational improvements on the sangamon river
before the election lincoln served as a captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war
following his return lincoln continued his campaign for the august 6 election for the illinois general assembly
at he was tall and strong enough to intimidate any rival
at his first speech when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked lincoln grabbed the assailant by his neck and the seat of his trousers and threw him
lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates the top four were elected though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the new salem precinct
lincoln served as new salem s postmaster and later as county surveyor all the while reading voraciously
he then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading blackstone s commentaries on the laws of england and other law books
of his learning method lincoln stated i studied with nobody
his second campaign in 1834 was successful
he won election to the state legislature though he ran as a whig many democrats favored him over a more powerful whig opponent
admitted to the bar in 1836 he moved to springfield illinois and began to practice law under john t stuart mary todd s cousin
lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross examinations and closing arguments
he partnered with stephen t logan from 1841 until 1844 when he began his practice with william herndon whom lincoln thought a studious young man
he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a whig representative from sangamon county
in the 1835 – 36 legislative session he voted to expand suffrage to white males whether landowners or not
he was known for his free soil stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism
he first articulated this in 1837 saying the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils
he closely followed henry clay in supporting the american colonization society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by helping the freed slaves to settle in liberia in africa
congressman lincoln from the early 1830s lincoln was a steadfast whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be an old line whig a disciple of henry clay
the party including lincoln favored economic modernization in banking protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads and espoused urbanization as well
in 1846 lincoln was elected to the u s house of representatives where he served one two year term
he was the only whig in the illinois delegation but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line
lincoln in collaboration with abolitionist congressman joshua r giddings wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners enforcement to capture fugitive slaves and a popular vote on the matter
he abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient whig supporters
on foreign and military policy lincoln spoke out against the mexican – american war which he attributed to president polk s desire for military glory — that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood
lincoln also supported the wilmot proviso which if it had been adopted would have banned slavery in any u s territory won from mexico
lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions
the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico and the u s polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil
lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil
congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it the national papers ignored it and it resulted in a loss of political support for lincoln in his district
one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln
lincoln later regretted some of his statements especially his attack on the presidential war making powers
realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency lincoln who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the house supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election
taylor won and lincoln hoped to be appointed commissioner of the general land office but that lucrative patronage job went to an illinois rival justin butterfield considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer but in lincoln s view an old fossil
the administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the oregon territory
this distant territory was a democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice
prairie lawyer lincoln returned to practicing law in springfield handling every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer
twice a year for 16 years 10 weeks at a time he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session
lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation s western expansion particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges
as a riverboat man lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him
his reputation grew and he appeared before the supreme court of the united states arguing a case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge
in 1849 he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water
the idea was never commercialized but lincoln is the only president to hold a patent
in 1851 he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders james a barret who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route
lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of barret s pledge the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer superior and less expensive route and the corporation retained the right to demand barret s payment
the decision by the illinois supreme court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation
lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases in 51 as sole counsel of which 31 were decided in his favor
from 1853 to 1860 another of lincoln s largest clients was the illinois central railroad
lincoln s most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker
the case is famous for lincoln s use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness
after an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility
based on this evidence armstrong was acquitted
lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom but in an 1859 case where he defended a cousin peachy harrison who was accused of stabbing another to death lincoln angrily protested the judge s decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client
instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as was expected the judge a democrat reversed his ruling allowing the evidence and acquitting harrison
republican politics 1854 – 60 slavery and a house divided by the 1850s slavery was still legal in the southern united states but had been generally outlawed in the northern states such as illinois
lincoln disapproved of slavery and the spread of slavery to new u s territory in the west
he returned to politics to oppose the pro slavery kansas – nebraska act 1854 this law repealed the slavery restricting missouri compromise 1820
senior senator stephen a douglas of illinois had incorporated popular sovereignty into the act
douglas provision which lincoln opposed specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new u s territory rather than have such a decision restricted by the national congress
eric foner 2010 contrasts the abolitionists and anti slavery radical republicans of the northeast who saw slavery as a sin with the conservative republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress
foner argues that lincoln was a moderate in the middle opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the founding fathers especially the equality of all men and democratic self government as expressed in the declaration of independence
on october 16 1854 in his peoria speech lincoln declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency
speaking in his kentucky accent with a very powerful voice he said the kansas act had a declared indifference but as i must think a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery
i can not but hate it
i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself
i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world in late 1854 lincoln ran as a whig for the u s senate seat from illinois
at that time senators were elected by the state legislature
after leading in the first six rounds of voting in the illinois assembly his support began to dwindle and lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull who defeated opponent joel aldrich matteson
the whigs had been irreparably split by the kansas – nebraska act
lincoln wrote i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist even though i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery
drawing on remnants of the old whig party and on disenchanted free soil liberty and democratic party members he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new republican party
at the 1856 republican national convention lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party s candidate for vice president
in 1857 – 1858 douglas broke with president james buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party
some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas for the senate in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state
in march 1857 the supreme court issued its decision in dred scott v sandford chief justice roger b taney opined that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution
lincoln denounced the decision alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power
lincoln argued the authors of the declaration of independence never intended to say all were equal in color size intellect moral developments or social capacity but they did consider all men created equal — equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
after the state republican party convention nominated him for the u s senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his house divided speech drawing on a house divided against itself can not stand
i believe this government can not endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved — i do not expect the house to fall — but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other
the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north
the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas as its u s senator
lincoln – douglas debates and cooper union speech the senate campaign featured the seven lincoln – douglas debates of 1858 the most famous political debates in american history
the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically
lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that all men are created equal while douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists
the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands
lincoln stated douglas popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation s morality and that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states
douglas said that lincoln was defying the authority of the u s supreme court and the dred scott decision
though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature re elected douglas to the senate
despite the bitterness of the defeat for lincoln his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation
in may 1859 lincoln purchased the illinois staats anzeiger a german language newspaper which was consistently supportive most of the state s 130 000 german americans voted democratic but there was republican support that a german language paper could mobilize
on february 27 1860 new york party leaders invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union to a group of powerful republicans
lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery
lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the republicans required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong
despite his inelegant appearance — many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly — lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the republican presidential nomination
journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience
historian donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced candidate to appear in one rival s william h seward own state at an event sponsored by the second rival s salmon p chase loyalists while not mentioning either by name during its delivery
in response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions lincoln said the taste is in my mouth a little
1860 presidential nomination and campaign on may 9 – 10 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur
lincoln s followers organized a campaign team led by david davis norman judd leonard swett and jesse dubois and lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency
exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father lincoln s supporters adopted the label of the rail candidate
on may 18 at the republican national convention in chicago lincoln s friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as william h seward and salmon p chase
a former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket
lincoln s success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff
on the third ballot pennsylvania put him over the top
pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs
lincoln s managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others while following lincoln s strong dictate to make no contracts that bind me
most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government with the dred scott decision and the presidency of james buchanan
throughout the 1850s lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession
meanwhile douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats
delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the democratic convention disagreeing with douglas position on popular sovereignty and ultimately selected john c breckinridge as their candidate
as douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches
instead he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the republican party
the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials
there were thousands of republican speakers who focused first on the party platform and second on lincoln s life story emphasizing his childhood poverty
the goal was to demonstrate the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts
the republican party s production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincoln s life and sold 100 000 to 200 000 copies
presidency 1860 election and secession on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a douglas john c breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party
he was the first president from the republican party
winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north and west no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 southern slave states and he won only two of 996 counties in all the southern states
lincoln received 1 866 452 votes douglas 1 376 957 votes breckinridge 849 781 votes and bell 588 789 votes
turnout was 82 2 percent with lincoln winning the free northern states as well as california and oregon
douglas won missouri and split new jersey with lincoln
bell won virginia tennessee and kentucky and breckinridge won the rest of the south
although lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote his victory in the electoral college was decisive lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123
there were fusion tickets in which all of lincoln s opponents combined to support the same slate of electors in new york new jersey and rhode island but even if the anti lincoln vote had been combined in every state lincoln still would have won a majority in the electoral college
as lincoln s election became evident secessionists made clear their intent to leave the union before he took office the next march
on december 20 1860 south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession by february 1 1861 florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas followed
six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the confederate states of america
the upper south and border states delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal
president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal
the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february 9 1861
there were attempts at compromise
the crittenden compromise would have extended the missouri compromise line of 1820 dividing the territories into slave and free contrary to the republican party s free soil platform
lincoln rejected the idea saying i will suffer death before i consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right
lincoln however did tacitly support the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress before lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states
that proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that congress would not interfere with slavery without southern consent
a few weeks before the war lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution
lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the constitution
en route to his inauguration by train lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north
the president elect then evaded possible assassins in baltimore who were uncovered by lincoln s head of security allan pinkerton
on february 23 1861 he arrived in disguise in washington d c which was placed under substantial military guard
lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no intention or inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies but friends
we must not be enemies the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature
the failure of the peace conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was implausible
by march 1861 no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms
meanwhile lincoln and nearly every republican leader agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated
beginning of the war the commander of fort sumter south carolina major robert anderson sent a request for provisions to washington and the execution of lincoln s order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war
on april 12 1861 confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter forcing them to surrender and began the war
historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion
william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war
donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood
but he also vowed not to surrender the forts
the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that
on april 15 lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75 000 troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states
this call forced the states to choose sides
virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the confederate capital despite the exposed position of richmond so close to union lines
north carolina tennessee and arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months
secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail kentucky tried to be neutral
troops headed south towards washington to protect the capital in response to lincoln s call
on april 19 secessionist mobs in baltimore that controlled the rail links attacked union troops traveling to the capital
george william brown the mayor of baltimore and other suspected maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned without a warrant as lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus
john merryman a leader in the secessionist group in maryland petitioned chief justice roger b taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus saying holding merryman without a hearing was unlawful
taney issued the writ thereby ordering merryman s release but lincoln ignored it
then and throughout the war lincoln came under heavy often attack from antiwar democrats called copperheads
assuming command for the union in the war after the fall of fort sumter lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion
lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commander in chief using unprecedented powers
he expanded his war powers and imposed a blockade on all the confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress and after suspending habeas corpus arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers
lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions
in addition lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict
the war effort was the source of continued disparagement of lincoln and dominated his time and attention
from the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions in the union army
copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue
conversely the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery
on august 6 1861 lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederate war effort
in practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the confederacy in late august 1861 general john c frémont the 1856 republican presidential nominee issued without consulting washington a proclamation of martial law in missouri
he declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court martial ed and shot and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed
frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the department of the west compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption
lincoln overruled frémont s proclamation
lincoln believed that fremont s emancipation was political neither militarily necessary nor legal
union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over 40 000 troops
the trent affair of late 1861 threatened war with great britain
the u s navy illegally intercepted a british merchant ship the trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys britain protested vehemently while the u s cheered
lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with britain
lincoln s foreign policy approach had been initially hands off due to his inexperience he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his secretary of state william seward
seward s initial reaction to the trent affair however was too bellicose so lincoln also turned to senator charles sumner the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and an expert in british diplomacy
to learn technical military terms lincoln borrowed and studied henry halleck s book elements of military art and science from the library of congress
lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the war department in washington d c
he kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort consulted with governors and selected generals based on their past success as well as their state and party
in january 1862 after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced simon cameron with edwin stanton as war secretary
stanton was one of many conservative democrats he supported breckenridge in the 1860 election who became anti slavery republicans under lincoln s leadership
in terms of war strategy lincoln articulated two priorities to ensure that washington was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the north for prompt decisive victory major northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days
twice a week lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon and occasionally mary lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard
lincoln learned from his chief of staff general henry halleck a student of the european strategist jomini of the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river he also knew well the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy s army rather than simply capturing territory
general mcclellan after the union defeat at the first battle of bull run and the retirement of the aged winfield scott in late 1861 lincoln appointed major general george b mcclellan general in chief of all the union armies
mcclellan a young west point graduate railroad executive and pennsylvania democrat took several months to plan and attempt his peninsula campaign longer than lincoln wanted
the campaign s objective was to capture richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the confederate capital
mcclellan s repeated delays frustrated lincoln and congress as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington
lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan s troops in defense of the capital mcclellan who consistently overestimated the strength of confederate troops blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign
lincoln removed mcclellan as general in chief and appointed henry wager halleck in march 1862 after mcclellan s harrison s landing letter in which he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort
mcclellan s letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia
pope complied with lincoln s strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack
however lacking requested reinforcements from mcclellan now commanding the army of the potomac pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time
the war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the css virginia formerly the uss merrimack damaged or destroyed three union vessels in norfolk virginia before being engaged and damaged by the uss monitor
lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the battle of hampton roads
despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan s failure to reinforce pope lincoln was desperate and restored him to command of all forces around washington to the dismay of all in his cabinet but seward
two days after mcclellan s return to command general robert e lee s forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam in september 1862
the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january
having composed the proclamation some time earlier lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation
mcclellan then resisted the president s demand that he pursue lee s retreating and exposed army while his counterpart general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee
as a result lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with republican ambrose burnside
both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the commander in chief
burnside against the advice of the president prematurely launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was stunningly defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december
not only had burnside been defeated on the battlefield but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined
desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after fredericksburg
lincoln brought in joseph hooker despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship
the mid term elections in 1862 brought the republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war as well as rising inflation new high taxes rumors of corruption the suspension of habeas corpus the military draft law and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market
the emancipation proclamation announced in september gained votes for the republicans in the rural areas of new england and the upper midwest but it lost votes in the cities and the lower midwest
while republicans were discouraged democrats were energized and did especially well in pennsylvania ohio indiana and new york
the republicans did maintain their majorities in congress and in the major states except new york
the cincinnati gazette contended that the voters were depressed by the interminable nature of this war as so far conducted and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress
in the spring of 1863 lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together these plans included hooker s attack on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grant s on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston
hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may but continued to command his troops for some weeks
he ignored lincoln s order to divide his troops and possibly force lee to do the same in harper s ferry and tendered his resignation which lincoln accepted
he was replaced by george meade who followed lee into pennsylvania for the gettysburg campaign which was a victory for the union though lee s army avoided capture
at the same time after initial setbacks grant laid siege to vicksburg and the union navy attained some success in charleston harbor
after the battle of gettysburg lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his war secretary or his general in chief on to his generals who resented his civilian interference with their own plans
even so he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as commander in chief
emancipation proclamation lincoln understood that the federal government s power to end slavery was limited by the constitution which before 1865 committed the issue to individual states
he argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new u s territory
at the beginning of the war he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery
lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it as envisioned by the founding fathers under the constitution
president lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by major general john c frémont in august 1861 and by major general david hunter in may 1862 on the grounds that it was not within their power and it would upset the border states loyal to the union
on june 19 1862 endorsed by lincoln congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory
in july 1862 the second confiscation act was passed which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion
although lincoln believed it was not within congress s power to free the slaves within the states he approved the bill in deference to the legislature
he felt such action could only be taken by the commander in chief using war powers granted to the president by the constitution and lincoln was planning to take that action
in that month lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet
in it he stated that as a fit and necessary military measure on january 1 1863 all persons held as slaves in the confederate states will thenceforward and forever be free
privately lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the confederacy had to be eliminated
however copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification
republican editor horace greeley of the highly influential new york tribune fell for the ploy and lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of august 22 1862
the president said the primary goal of his actions as president he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his official duty was preserving the union the emancipation proclamation issued on september 22 1862 and put into effect on january 1 1863 declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas already under union control in two states
lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites
once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in confederate territory were freed
lincoln s comment on the signing of the proclamation was i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper
for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves
he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed
a few days after emancipation was announced 13 republican governors met at the war governors conference they supported the president s proclamation but suggested the removal of general george b mcclellan as commander of the union army
using former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the emancipation proclamation
by the spring of 1863 he was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers
in a letter to andrew johnson the military governor of tennessee encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote the bare sight of 50 000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once
by the end of 1863 at lincoln s direction general lorenzo thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley
frederick douglass once observed of lincoln in his company i was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color
gettysburg address with the great union victory at the battle of gettysburg in july 1863 and the defeat of the copperheads in the ohio election in the fall lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort despite the new york city draft riots
the stage was set for his address at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery
defying lincoln s prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here the address became the most quoted speech in american history
the gettysburg address was delivered at the dedication of the soldiers national cemetery in gettysburg pennsylvania on the afternoon of thursday november 19 1863
in 272 words and three minutes lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all
the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort
he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as a result of the losses and the future of democracy would be assured that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
lincoln concluded that the civil war had a profound objective a new birth of freedom in the nation
general grant meade s failure to capture lee s army as it retreated from gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln that a change in command was needed
general ulysses s grant s victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln and made grant a strong candidate to head the union army
responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said i ca n t spare this man
he fights
with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops
nevertheless lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a candidacy for president in 1864 as mcclellan was
lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into grant s political intentions and being assured that he had none submitted to the senate grant s promotion to commander of the union army
he obtained congress s consent to reinstate for grant the rank of lieutenant general which no officer had held since george washington
grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864
this is often characterized as a war of attrition given high union losses at battles such as the battle of the wilderness and cold harbor
even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive the confederate forces had almost as high a percentage of casualties as the union forces
the high casualty figures of the union alarmed the north grant had lost a third of his army and lincoln asked what grant s plans were to which the general replied i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer
the confederacy lacked reinforcements so lee s army shrank with every costly battle
grant s army moved south crossed the james river forcing a siege and trench warfare outside petersburg virginia
lincoln then made an extended visit to grant s headquarters at city point virginia
this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and william tecumseh sherman about the hostilities as sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to grant from his position in north carolina
lincoln and the republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the north and replaced his losses
lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructure — such as plantations railroads and bridges — hoping to destroy the south s morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting
grant s move to petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between richmond and the south
this strategy allowed generals sherman and philip sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in virginia s shenandoah valley
the damage caused by sherman s march to the sea through georgia in 1864 was limited to a swath but neither lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal but rather defeat of the confederate armies
as neely 2004 concludes there was no effort to engage in total war against civilians as in world war ii
confederate general jubal anderson early began a series of assaults in the north that threatened the capital
during early s raid on washington d c in 1864 lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot
after repeated calls on grant to defend washington sheridan was appointed and the threat from early was dispatched
as grant continued to wear down lee s forces efforts to discuss peace began
confederate vice president stephens led a group to meet with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads
lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as a coequal his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results
on april 1 1865 grant successfully outflanked lee s forces in the battle of five forks and nearly encircled petersburg and the confederate government evacuated richmond
days later when that city fell lincoln visited the vanquished confederate capital as he walked through the city white southerners were stone faced but freedmen greeted him as a hero
on april 9 lee surrendered to grant at appomattox and the war was effectively over
1864 re election lincoln was a master politician bringing together — and holding together — all the main factions of the republican party and bringing in war democrats such as edwin m stanton and andrew johnson as well
lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers — greatly expanded over peacetime — to hold the factions of his party together build support for his own policies and fend off efforts by radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket
at its 1864 convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate
to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party
when grant s 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and union casualties mounted the lack of military success wore heavily on the president s re election prospects and many republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated
sharing this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope
while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform
lincoln provided grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of grant in the war effort
sherman s capture of atlanta in september and david farragut s capture of mobile ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln
by contrast the national union party was united and energized as lincoln made emancipation the central issue and state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads
lincoln was re elected in a landslide carrying all but three states and receiving 78 percent of the union soldiers vote
on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address
in it he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be god s will
historian mark noll concludes it ranks among the small handful of semi sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world
lincoln said reconstruction reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves
shortly after lee s surrender a general had asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated and lincoln replied let em up easy
in keeping with that sentiment lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radical republicans under rep thaddeus stevens sen charles sumner and sen benjamin wade political allies of the president on other issues
determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war
his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance
as southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re formed
of special importance were tennessee and arkansas where lincoln appointed generals andrew johnson and frederick steele as military governors respectively
in louisiana lincoln ordered general nathaniel p banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it
lincoln s democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations
on the other hand the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the wade davis bill in 1864
when lincoln vetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee
lincoln s appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and radical factions in harness
to fill chief justice taney s seat on the supreme court he named the choice of the radicals salmon p chase who lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies
after implementing the emancipation proclamation which did not apply to every state lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment
lincoln declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter
by december 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery absolutely was brought to congress for passage
this first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required two thirds majority on june 15 1864 in the house of representatives
passage of the proposed amendment became part of the republican unionist platform in the election of 1864
after a long debate in the house a second attempt passed congress on january 31 1865 and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification
upon ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6 1865
as the war drew to a close lincoln s presidential reconstruction for the south was in flux having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen
he signed into law senator charles sumner s freedman s bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves
the law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen
lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction
shortly before his assassination lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern reconstruction
discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned short term military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern unionists
redefining the republic and republicanism the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country
the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular without any particular grammatical consistency
the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century
in recent years historians such as harry jaffa herman belz john diggins vernon burton and eric foner have stressed lincoln s redefinition of republican values
as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values — what he called the sheet anchor of republicanism
the declaration s emphasis on freedom and equality for all in contrast to the constitution s tolerance of slavery shifted the debate
as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early 1860 lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself
his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms
nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state
burton 2008 argues that lincoln s republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated
in march 1861 in his first inaugural address lincoln explored the nature of democracy
he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system
he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people
other enactments lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them
lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by congress the only important one was the wade davis bill with its harsh program of reconstruction
he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of government held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost
the morrill land grant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state
the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869
the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was made possible by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s
other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs a policy with long precedent and a new federal income tax
in 1861 lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariff the first having become law under james buchanan
also in 1861 lincoln signed the revenue act of 1861 creating the first u s income tax
this created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above 800 in current dollar terms which was later changed by the revenue act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure
lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government s economic influence in several other areas
the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking act provided a strong financial network in the country
it also established a national currency
in 1862 congress created with lincoln s approval the department of agriculture
in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota
presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants eventually approving 39 for execution one was later reprieved
president lincoln had planned to reform federal indian policy
in the wake of grant s casualties in his campaign against lee lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft but it was never issued
in response to rumors of one however the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market
lincoln s reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior he ordered the military to seize the two papers
the seizure lasted for two days
lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the thanksgiving holiday in the united states
before lincoln s presidency thanksgiving while a regional holiday in new england since the 17th century had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates
the last such proclamation had been during james madison s presidency 50 years before
in 1863 lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving
in june 1864 lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park
judicial appointments supreme court appointments lincoln s declared philosophy on court nominations was that we can not ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it
therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known
lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court
noah haynes swayne nominated january 21 1862 and appointed january 24 1862 was chosen as an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the union
samuel freeman miller nominated and appointed on july 16 1862 supported lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist
david davis lincoln s campaign manager in 1860 nominated december 1 1862 and appointed december 8 1862 had also served as a judge in lincoln s illinois court circuit
stephen johnson field a previous california supreme court justice was nominated march 6 1863 and appointed march 10 1863 and provided geographic balance as well as political balance to the court as a democrat
finally lincoln s treasury secretary salmon p chase was nominated as chief justice and appointed the same day on december 6 1864
lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party
other judicial appointmentslincoln appointed 32 federal judges including four associate justices and one chief justice to the supreme court of the united states and 27 judges to the united states district courts
lincoln appointed no judges to the united states circuit court s during his time in office
states admitted to the union west virginia admitted to the union june 20 1863 contained the former north westernmost counties of virginia that seceded from virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the union
as a condition for its admission west virginia s constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery
nevada which became the third state in the far west of the continent was admitted as a free state on october 31 1864
assassination john wilkes booth was a well known actor and a confederate spy from maryland though he never joined the confederate army he had contacts with the confederate secret service
in 1864 booth formulated a plan very similar to one of thomas n conrad previously authorized by the confederacy to kidnap lincoln in exchange for the release of confederate prisoners
after attending an april 11 1865 speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks an incensed booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president
learning that the president first lady and head union general ulysses s grant would be attending ford s theatre booth formulated a plan with co conspirators to assassinate vice president andrew johnson secretary of state william h seward and general grant
without his main bodyguard ward hill lamon lincoln left to attend the play our american cousin on april 14
grant along with his wife chose at the last minute to travel to philadelphia instead of attending the play
lincoln s bodyguard john parker left ford s theater during intermission to join lincoln s coachman for drinks in the star saloon next door
the now unguarded president sat in his state box in the balcony
seizing the opportunity booth crept up from behind and at about 10 13 pm aimed at the back of lincoln s head and fired at point blank range mortally wounding the president
major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but booth stabbed him and escaped
after being on the run for 10 days booth was tracked down and found on a farm in virginia some south of washington d c
after a brief fight with union troops booth was killed by sergeant boston corbett on april 26
an army surgeon doctor charles leale was sitting nearby at the theater and immediately assisted the president
he found the president unresponsive barely breathing and with no detectable pulse
having determined that the president had been shot in the head and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought he made an attempt to clear the blood clot after which the president began to breathe more naturally
the dying man was taken across the street to petersen house
after being in a coma for nine hours lincoln died at 7 22 am on april 15
presbyterian minister phineas densmore gurley then present was asked to offer a prayer after which secretary of war stanton saluted and said now he belongs to the ages
lincoln s flag enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the white house by bareheaded union officers while the city s church bells rang
president johnson was sworn in at 10 00 am less than 3 hours after lincoln s death
the late president lay in state in the east room and then in the capitol rotunda from april 19 through april 21
for his final journey with his son willie both caskets were transported in the executive coach united states and for three weeks the lincoln special funeral train decorated in black bunting bore lincoln s remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from washington d c to springfield illinois stopping at many cities across the north for large scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands bonfires and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by
religious and philosophical beliefs as a young man lincoln was clearly a religious skeptic or in the words of a biographer even an iconoclast
later in life lincoln s frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants
he never joined a church although he frequently attended with his wife but he was deeply familiar with the bible quoted it and praised it
in the 1840s lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power
in the 1850s lincoln acknowledged providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence
when he suffered the death of his son edward lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on god
the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace
after willie s death lincoln considered why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary
he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest
yet the contest began
and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day
yet the contest proceeds
on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife mary at ford s theatre he desired to visit the holy land
historical reputation in surveys of scholars ranking presidents since the 1940s lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three often 1
a 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after washington
of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since 1948 lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls schlesinger 1948 schlesinger 1962 1982 murray blessing survey chicago tribune 1982 poll schlesinger 1996 cspan 1996 ridings mciver 1996 time 2008 and cspan 2009
generally the top three presidents are rated as 1 lincoln 2 george washington and 3 franklin d roosevelt although lincoln and washington and washington and roosevelt occasionally are reversed
president lincoln s assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion
lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty
republicans linked lincoln s name to their party
many though not all in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability
schwartz argues that lincoln s reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the progressive era 1900 – 1920s when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in american history with even white southerners in agreement
the high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the mall in washington
in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state
in the cold war years lincoln s image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes
by the 1970s lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers
as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks internal improvements and railroads in opposition to the agrarian democrats
william c harris found that lincoln s reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism
james g randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform
randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders
by the late 1960s liberals such as historian lerone bennett were having second thoughts especially regarding lincoln s views on racial issues
bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968
he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs told jokes that ridiculed blacks insisted he opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country
defenders such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible
the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation
historian barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincoln s image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late 20th century
on the other hand donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason
memorials lincoln appears on the penny and the 5 bill and on many postage stamps
he has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the capital of nebraska
the most famous and most visited memorials are the lincoln memorial in washington d c lincoln s sculpture on mount rushmore ford s theatre and petersen house where he died in washington and the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum located in springfield illinois not far from lincoln s home and his tomb
barry schwartz a sociologist who has examined america s cultural memory argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life
during the great depression he argues lincoln served as a means for seeing the world s disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful
franklin d roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan
americans asked what would lincoln do
however he also finds that since world war ii lincoln s symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness
he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept

aristotle aristotélēs 384 bc – 322 bc was a greek philosopher and polymath a student of plato and teacher of alexander the great
his writings cover many subjects including physics metaphysics poetry theater music logic rhetoric linguistics politics government ethics biology and zoology
together with plato and socrates plato s teacher aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in western philosophy
aristotle s writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of western philosophy encompassing morality aesthetics logic science politics and metaphysics
aristotle s views on the physical sciences profoundly shaped medieval scholarship and their influence extended well into the renaissance although they were ultimately replaced by newtonian physics
in the zoological sciences some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the 19th century
his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic
in metaphysics aristotelianism had a profound influence on philosophical and theological thinking in the islamic and jewish traditions in the middle ages and it continues to influence christian theology especially the scholastic tradition of the catholic church
aristotle was well known among medieval muslim intellectuals and revered as المعلم الأول the first teacher
his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics
all aspects of aristotle s philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today
though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues cicero described his literary style as a river of gold it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one third of the original works have survived
life aristotle whose name means the best purpose was born in stagira chalcidice in 384 bc about east of modern day thessaloniki
his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon
although there is little information on aristotle childhood he probably did spend some time then in the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy
at about the age of eighteen he went to athens to continue his education at plato s academy
aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in 348 47 bc
the traditional story about his departure reports that he was disappointed with the direction the academy took after control passed to plato s nephew speusippus upon his death although it is possible that he feared anti macedonian sentiments and left before plato had died
he then traveled with xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor
while in asia aristotle traveled with theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island
aristotle married hermias s adoptive daughter or niece pythias
she bore him a daughter whom they named pythias
soon after hermias death aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander in 343 bc
aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon
during that time he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander
aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric
in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants
by 335 bc he had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum
aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years
while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him a son whom he named after his father nicomachus
according to the suda he also had an eromenos palaephatus of abydus
it is during this period in athens from 335 to 323 bc when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works
aristotle wrote many dialogues only fragments of which survived
the works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students
his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics de anima on the soul and poetics
aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time but made significant contributions to most of them
in physical science aristotle studied anatomy astronomy embryology geography geology meteorology physics and zoology
in philosophy he wrote on aesthetics ethics government metaphysics politics economics psychology rhetoric and theology
he also studied education foreign customs literature and poetry
his combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of greek knowledge
it has been suggested that aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time
near the end of alexander s life alexander began to suspect plots against himself and threatened aristotle in letters
aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for alexander s pretense of divinity and the king had executed aristotle s grandnephew callisthenes as a traitor
a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexander s death but there is little evidence for this
upon alexander s death anti macedonian sentiment in athens once again flared
eurymedon the hierophant denounced aristotle for not holding the gods in honor
aristotle fled the city to his mother s family estate in chalcis explaining i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy a reference to athens s prior trial and execution of socrates
he died in euboea of natural causes within the year in 322 bc
aristotle named chief executor his student antipater and left a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife
thought logic with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until 19th century advances in mathematical logic
kant stated in the critique of pure reason that aristotle s theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference
historyaristotle says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of
however plato reports that syntax was devised before him by prodicus of ceos who was concerned by the correct use of words
logic seems to have emerged from dialectics the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions but never truly understood the logical implications
even plato had difficulties with logic although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system he could never actually construct one and relied instead on his dialectic
plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premise s hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow
consequently plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial
he never succeeded in devising such a method but his best attempt was published in his book sophist where he introduced his division method
analytics and the organon what we today call aristotelian logic aristotle himself would have labeled analytics
the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics
most of aristotle s work is probably not in its original form since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers
the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century ad the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle s writings
it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations
the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning
there is one volume of aristotle s concerning logic not found in the organon namely the fourth book of metaphysics
aristotle s scientific method like his teacher plato aristotle s philosophy aims at the universal
aristotle however finds the universal in particular things which he calls the essence of things while plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar
for aristotle therefore philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences while for plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal forms or ideas to a contemplation of particular imitations of these
for aristotle form still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is instantiated in a particular substance see universals and particulars below
in a certain sense aristotle s method is both inductive and deductive while plato s is essentially deductive from a priori principles
in aristotle s terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences
in modern times the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries such as ethics and metaphysics in which logic plays a major role
today s philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method
in contrast aristotle s philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry
in the larger sense of the word aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science
note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method
for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics 1025b25
by practical science he means ethics and politics by poetical science he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts by theoretical science he means physics mathematics and metaphysics
if logic or analytics is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy the divisions of aristotelian philosophy would consist of 1 logic 2 theoretical philosophy including metaphysics physics and mathematics 3 practical philosophy and 4 poetical philosophy
in the period between his two stays in athens between his times at the academy and the lyceum aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today
in fact most of aristotle s life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science
aristotle s metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics
he did however perform original research in the natural sciences e g botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology and several other sciences
aristotle s writings on science are largely qualitative as opposed to quantitative
beginning in the 16th century scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences and aristotle s work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate
his failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass velocity force and temperature
he had a conception of speed and temperature but no quantitative understanding of them which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices like clocks and thermometers
his writings provide an account of many scientific observations a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors
for example in his history of animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females
in a similar vein john philoponus and later galileo showed by simple experiments that aristotle s theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect
on the other hand aristotle refuted democritus s claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun s rays pointing out correctly even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time that given current astronomical demonstrations that the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them
in places aristotle goes too far in deriving laws of the universe from simple observation and over stretched reason
today s scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective and that discerning the validity of one s hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which aristotle used to support his laws
aristotle also had some scientific blind spots
he posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics which was widely accepted up until the 16th century
from the 3rd century to the 16th century the dominant view held that the earth was the rotational center of the universe
since he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by european thinkers during and after the renaissance these thinkers often took aristotle s erroneous positions as given which held back science in this epoch
however aristotle s scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields
for instance he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia
moreover he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants
geology as quoted from principles of geology he aristotle refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages
he instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized
he points to the growth of the nilotic delta since the time of homer to the shallowing of the palus maeotis within sixty years from his own time he alludes to the upheaving of one of the eolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption
the changes of the earth he says are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives that they are overlooked and the migrations of people after great catastrophes and their removal to other regions cause the event to be forgotten
he says 12th chapter of his meteorics the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land and again it becomes land where it was sea and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system and within a certain period
the concluding observation is as follows as time never fails and the universe is eternal neither the tanais nor the nile can have flowed for ever
the places where they rise were once dry and there is a limit to their operations but there is none to time
so also of all other rivers they spring up and they perish and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others the same tracts therefore of the earth are not some always sea and others always continents but every thing changes in the course of time
physics five elements aristotle proposed a fifth element aether in addition to the four proposed earlier by empedocles
each of the four earthly elements has its natural place
all that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe i e the center of the earth
water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center
air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere
fire tends toward the lunar sphere in which the moon orbits
when elements are moved out of their natural place they naturally move back towards it
this is natural motion — motion requiring no extrinsic cause
so for example in water earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up in air rain falls and flame rises
outside all the other spheres the heavenly fifth element manifested in the stars and planets moves in the perfection of circles
motion aristotle defined motion as the actuality of a potentiality as such
aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential as a transition toward a potentially possible state
because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in aristotle other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous or that the addition of the as such to the definition is critical to understanding it
causality the four causes aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors additionally things can be causes of one another causing each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal
thus aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect
moreover aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects its presence and absence may result in different outcomes
simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event not necessarily a mental goal
taking our two dominos it requires someone to intentionally knock the dominos over as they can not fall themselves
aristotle marked two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation
all causes proper and incidental can be spoken as potential or as actual particular or generic
the same language refers to the effects of causes so that generic effects assigned to generic causes particular effects to particular causes operating causes to actual effects
essentially causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect
opticsaristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day
the earliest known written evidence of a camera obscura can be found in aristotle s documentation of such a device in 350 bc in problemata
aristotle s apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole or aperture to allow for sunlight to enter
aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object
in modern cameras this is analogous to the diaphragm
aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased the image was magnified
chance and spontaneityaccording to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause
chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things
it is from what is spontaneous but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance
for a better understanding of aristotle s conception of chance it might be better to think of coincidence something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not intended taking place
for example a person seeks donations
that person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum
however if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance
it must be unusual that something happens by chance
in other words if something happens all or most of the time we can not say that it is by chance
there is also more specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that can only apply to human beings since it is in the sphere of moral actions
according to aristotle luck must involve choice and thus deliberation and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice
what is not capable of action can not do anything by chance
metaphysics aristotle defines metaphysics as the knowledge of immaterial being or of being in the highest degree of abstraction
he refers to metaphysics as first philosophy as well as the theologic science
substance potentiality and actuality aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence ousia in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form
in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed
for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia see also predicables that let us define something as a house
the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form
with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption 319b 320a he distinguishes the coming to be from the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property
in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form
referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else
for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become a plant
potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned
for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate – being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise – acting
actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality
because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end
referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do
for that for the sake of which a thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired
for animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see
in summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end
then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality
with this definition of the particular substance i e matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one
since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity
however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same thing
universals and particulars aristotle s predecessor plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things
when we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyze a form of an apple
in this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple
moreover we can place an apple next to a book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other
plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things
for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form
bertrand russell is a contemporary philosopher who agreed with plato on the existence of uninstantiated universals
aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated
aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things
according to aristotle if a universal exists either as a particular or a relation then there must have been must be currently or must be in the future something on which the universal can be predicated
consequently according to aristotle if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time then it does not exist
in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals
as plato spoke of the world of the forms a location where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated
so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms
biology and medicine in aristotelian science most especially in biology things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others which contain error and superstition
he dissected animals but not humans his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded
empirical research program aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail
aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of lesbos and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas
the works that reflect this research such as history of animals generation of animals and parts of animals contain some observations and interpretations along with sundry myths and mistakes
the most striking passages are about the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen
his observations on catfish electric fish torpedo and angler fish are detailed as is his writing on cephalopod s namely octopus sepia cuttlefish and the paper nautilus argonauta argo
his description of the hectocotyl arm was about two thousand years ahead of its time and widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century
he separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selachē selachians
another good example of his methods comes from the generation of animals in which aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated
he gave accurate descriptions of ruminant s four chambered fore stomachs and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark mustelus mustelus
classification of living thingsaristotle s classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century
what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates aristotle called animals with blood and animals without blood he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of hemoglobin but of a different kind from vertebrates
animals with blood were divided into live bearing humans and mammals and egg bearing birds and fish
invertebrates animals without blood are insects crustacea divided into non shelled – cephalopods – and shelled and testacea molluscs
in some respects this incomplete classification is better than that of linnaeus who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups insecta and vermes worms
for charles singer nothing is more remarkable than aristotle s efforts to exhibit the relationships of living things as a scala naturae aristotle s history of animals classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical ladder of life scala naturae placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move
aristotle believed that intellectual purposes i e final cause s guided all natural processes
such a teleological view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design
noting that no animal has at the same time both tusks and horns and a single hooved animal with two horns i have never seen aristotle suggested that nature giving no animal both horns and tusks was staving off vanity and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary
noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter with nature trying to preserve a type of balance
in a similar fashion aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man the scala naturae or great chain of being
his system had eleven grades arranged according to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality expressed in their form at birth
the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive the lowest bore theirs cold dry and in thick eggs
aristotle also held that the level of a creature s perfection was reflected in its form but not preordained by that form
ideas like this and his ideas about souls are not regarded as science at all in modern times
he placed emphasis on the type s of soul an organism possessed asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul responsible for reproduction and growth animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul responsible for mobility and sensation and humans a vegetative a sensitive and a rational soul capable of thought and reflection
aristotle in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain
notable is aristotle s division of sensation and thought which generally went against previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon
successor theophrastus aristotle s successor at the lyceum theophrastus wrote a series of books on botany — the history of plants — which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany even into the middle ages
many of theophrastus names survive into modern times such as carpos for fruit and pericarpion for seed vessel
rather than focus on formal causes as aristotle did theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes and relying on aristotle s concept of the efficient cause
theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants though this last discovery was lost in later ages
influence on hellenistic medicine after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work
though interest in aristotle s ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly
it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found
the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation
herophilus also distinguished between vein s and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not
though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries
ernst mayr claimed that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance
aristotle s ideas of natural history and medicine survived but they were generally taken unquestioningly
psychology aristotle s psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psyche often known by its latin title de anima posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul
humans have a rational soul
this kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally
the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them
for aristotle the soul psyche was a simpler concept than it is for us today
by soul he simply meant the form of a living being
since all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings e g the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement
practical philosophy ethics aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study i e one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake
he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics
aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of a thing
an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight
aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē normally translated as soul in accordance with reason logos
aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being
to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ēthikē aretē often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence
aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things
when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher
politics in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics
aristotle considered the city to be a natural community
moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part
he also famously stated that man is by nature a political animal
aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others
aristotle s conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner
the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different to aristotle s understanding
although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as a political community or partnership koinōnia
the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together
this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences
rhetoric and poetics aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative each varying in imitation by medium object and manner
for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language
the forms also differ in their object of imitation
comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average
lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama
aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind s advantages over animals
while it is believed that aristotle s poetics comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived
aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry
the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy
tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions
aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis
he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic
aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop
views on women aristotle s analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element
on this ground feminists have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism
however aristotle gave equal weight to women s happiness as he did to men s and commented in his rhetoric that a society can not be happy unless women are happy too
loss and preservation of his works modern scholarship reveals that aristotle s lost works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus
whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication the surviving works do not appear to have been so
rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication
the authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally aristotelian is also today held suspect with some books duplicating or summarizing each other the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely aristotle s at all
some of the individual works within the corpus including the constitution of athens are regarded by most scholars as products of aristotle s school perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision
others such as on colors may have been produced by aristotle s successors at the lyceum e g theophrastus and straton
still others acquired aristotle s name through similarities in doctrine or content such as the de plantis possibly by nicolaus of damascus
other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to aristotle are purely fanciful and self promotional
according to a distinction that originates with aristotle himself his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric and the esoteric
most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works aristotle intended for the public exoteric and the more technical works intended for use within the school esoteric
modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be aristotle s own unpolished lecture notes or in some cases possible notes by his students
however one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation
the 5th century neoplatonist ammonius hermiae writes that aristotle s writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these
another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of aristotle s extant writings are of the esoteric kind
current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious though many of them may have been in dialogue form
fragments of some of aristotle s dialogues have survived
perhaps it is to these that cicero refers when he characterized aristotle s writing style as a river of gold it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us
however some modern scholars have warned that we can not know for certain that cicero s praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in aristotle s extant works
one major question in the history of aristotle s works then is how were the exoteric writings all lost and how did the ones we now possess come to us
the story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by strabo in his geography and plutarch in his parallel lives
the manuscripts were left from aristotle to his successor theophrastus who in turn willed them to neleus of scepsis
neleus supposedly took the writings from athens to scepsis where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century bc when apellicon of teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts bringing them back to athens
according to the story apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts stay in the basement introducing a number of errors into the text
when lucius cornelius sulla occupied athens in 86 bc he carried off the library of apellicon to rome where they were first published in 60 bc by the grammarian tyrannion of amisus and then by the philosopher andronicus of rhodes
carnes lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the peripatetic school after the middle of the third century and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of aristotle throughout the hellenistic period as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing aristotelianism during the first century b c lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story however
first the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by apellicon s inexpert attempt at repair
second there is incontrovertible evidence lord says that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which strabo and plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in scepsis
third the definitive edition of aristotle s texts seems to have been made in athens some fifty years before andronicus supposedly compiled his
and fourth ancient library catalogues predating andronicus intervention list an aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess
lord sees a number of post aristotelian interpolations in the politics for example but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact
on the one hand the surviving texts of aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts but rather from working drafts used within aristotle s school as opposed on the other hand to the dialogues and other exoteric texts which aristotle published more widely during his lifetime
the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle s school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today
legacy more than twenty three hundred years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived
he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields
according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did
among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method
despite these achievements the influence of aristotle s errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably
bertrand russell notes that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine
russell also refers to aristotle s ethics as repulsive and calls his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy
russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors
later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotle s work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school
aristotle s notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion meno mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus
aristotle s influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers
he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher
although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle s geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all men s common property
influence on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus
the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were john philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century
john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotle s views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought
after a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena
influence on islamic theologians aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology
most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as a number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars
averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers
alkindus considered aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers
medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher
the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy
in accordance with the greek theorists the muslims considered aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher the author of a closed system and believed that aristotle shared with plato essential tenets of thought
some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo platonic metaphysical ideas
influence on western christian theologians with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from c ad 600 to c 1100 except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke
after thomas aquinas wrote his theology working from moerbeke s translations the demand for aristotle s writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance
aristotle is referred to as the philosopher by scholastic thinkers such as thomas aquinas
see summa theologica part i question 3 etc
these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages
it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods
the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the first circles of hell post enlightenment thinkers the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle
however implausible this is it is certainly the case that aristotle s rigid separation of action from production and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue – or arete – of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy
it is martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition
ayn rand accredited aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as a major influence on her thinking
more recently alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans
list of works the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum
these texts as opposed to aristotle s lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle s school
reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekker s royal prussian academy edition aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica berlin 1831 – 1870 which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works
honours aristotle mountains on oscar ii coast in graham land antarctica are named after aristotle

an american in paris is a symphonic tone poem by the american composer george gershwin written in 1928
inspired by the time gershwin had spent in paris it evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the 1920s
it is one of gershwin s best known compositions
gershwin composed an american in paris on commission from the new york philharmonic
he scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophone s and automobile horns
he brought back some parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december 13 1928 in carnegie hall with walter damrosch conducting the new york symphony
gershwin completed the orchestration on november 18 less than four weeks before the work s premiere
gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer deems taylor noting that my purpose here is to portray the impression of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere
when the tone poem moves into the blues our american friend has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness
but nostalgia is not a fatal disease
the american visitor once again is an alert spectator of parisian life and the street noises and french atmosphere are triumphant
background maurice ravel met gershwin in new york during ravel s tour of the united states
in that meeting gershwin asked ravel to be his teacher to which ravel responded that it was better to be a first rate gershwin than a second rate ravel
instead ravel recommended that gershwin see nadia boulanger in paris
ravel s high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking time to study abroad in paris
gershwin arrived in paris in march 1928
paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound w b yeats ernest hemingway and artist pablo picasso
gershwin met with boulanger and at her request he played ten minutes of his music
boulanger replied that she had nothing to teach him
this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue
composition gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called very parisienne written in 1926 on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer
he described the piece as a rhapsodic ballet because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works
gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere
the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose aba format
gershwin s first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio
the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six
this a section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns
the b section s andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness
the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve bar blues
in the b section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum
moderato con grazia is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final “ grandioso
” instrumentation an american in paris is scored for 3 flute s 3rd doubling on piccolo 2 oboe s english horn 2 clarinet s in b flat bass clarinet in b flat 2 bassoon s 4 horn s in f 3 trumpet s in b flat 3 trombone s tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block cymbal s low and high tom tom s xylophone glockenspiel celesta 4 taxi horns resembling the pitches a b c and d alto saxophone soprano saxophone tenor saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone baritone saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone and strings
the revised edition by f campbell watson calls for three saxophones alto tenor and baritone
in this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments
william daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by new world music in 1929
response gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch s interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris
he stated that damrosch s sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work
the audience according to edward cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses
critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than his lukewarm concerto in f
some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers césar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere
gershwin responded to the critics it s not a beethoven symphony you know … it s a humorous piece nothing solemn about it
it s not intended to draw tears
if it pleases symphony audiences as a light jolly piece a series of impressions musically expressed it succeeds
recordings an american in paris has been frequently recorded
the first recording was made for rca victor in 1929 with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra
gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio
then a little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording
the radio broadcast of the september 8 1937 hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert in which an american in paris also conducted by shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two cd set
arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music
in 1945 arturo toscanini and the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the music in carnegie hall one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer
the seattle symphony also recorded a version in the 1980s of gershwin s original score before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today
use in film in 1951 mgm released the musical an american in paris featuring gene kelly and leslie caron
winning the 1951 best picture oscar and numerous other awards the film was directed by vincente minnelli featured many tunes of gershwin and concluded with an extensive elaborate dance sequence built around the an american in paris symphonic poem arranged for the film by johnny green costing 500 000
a part of the symphonic composition is also featured in as good as it gets released in 1997

the academy awards now officially known as the oscars are a set of awards given annually for excellence of cinematic achievements
the oscar statuette is officially named the academy award of merit and is one of nine types of academy awards
organized and overseen by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ampas the awards are given each year at a formal ceremony
the ampas was originally conceived by metro goldwyn mayer studio executive louis b mayer as a professional honorary organization to help improve the film industry ’s image and help mediate labor disputes
the awards themselves were later initiated by the academy as awards of merit for distinctive achievement in the industry
the awards were first given in 1929 at a ceremony created for the awards at the hotel roosevelt in hollywood
over the years that the award has been given the categories presented have changed currently oscars are given in more than a dozen categories and include films of various types
as one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world the academy awards ceremony is televised live in more than 100 countries annually
it is also the oldest award ceremony in the media its equivalents the grammy awards for music the emmy awards for television and the tony awards for theater are all modeled after the academy awards
the 85th academy awards were held on sunday february 24 2013 at the dolby theatre in los angeles california
the 86th academy awards will be held on sunday march 2 2014 at the dolby theatre in los angeles
this will be a week later than normal as not to interfere with the 2014 winter olympics
history the first awards were presented on may 16 1929 at a private brunch at the hollywood roosevelt hotel with an audience of about 270 people
the post academy awards party was held at the mayfair hotel
the cost of guest tickets for that night s ceremony was 5
fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other personalities of the filmmaking industry of the time for their works during the 1927 – 1928 period
winners had been announced three months earlier however that was changed in the second ceremony of the academy awards in 1930
since then and during the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 pm on the night of the awards
this method was used until the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners
for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years
for example the 2nd academy awards presented on april 3 1930 recognized films that were released between august 1 1928 and july 31 1929
starting with the 7th academy awards held in 1935 the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from january 1 to december 31
the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh
he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first academy award winner in history
the honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films
since the fourth ceremony the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film
a total of 2 809 oscars have been given for 1 853 awards
a total of 302 actors have won oscars in competitive acting categories or have been awarded honorary or juvenile awards
the 1939 film beau geste is the only movie starring as many as four academy award winners for best actor or best actress in a leading role gary cooper ray milland susan hayward broderick crawford prior to any of the actors receiving the best actor award
at the 29th ceremony held on march 27 1957 the best foreign language film category was introduced
until then foreign language films were honored with the special achievement award
oscar statuette design although there are eight other types of annual awards presented by the academy the irving g thalberg memorial award the jean hersholt humanitarian award the gordon e sawyer award the academy scientific and technical award the academy award for technical achievement the john a bonner medal of commendation and the student academy award plus two awards that are not presented annually the special achievement award in the form of an oscar statuette and the honorary award that may or may not be in the form of an oscar statuette the best known one is the academy award of merit more popularly known as the oscar statuette
made of gold plated britannium on a black metal base it is 13 5 in 34 cm tall weighs 8 5 lb 3 85 kg and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a crusader s sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes
the five spokes each represent the original branches of the academy actors writers directors producers and technicians
in 1928 mgm s art director cedric gibbons one of the original academy members supervised the design of the award trophy by printing the design on a scroll
in need of a model for his statuette gibbons was introduced by his future wife dolores del río to mexican film director and actor emilio el indio fernández
reluctant at first fernández was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the oscar
then sculptor george stanley who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl sculpted gibbons s design in clay and sachin smith cast the statuette in 92 5 percent tin and 7 5 percent copper and then gold plated it
the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base
the original oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the c w shumway sons foundry in batavia illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy award s statuettes
since 1983 approximately 50 oscars are made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer r s owens company
in support of the american effort in world war ii the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended
naming the origin of the name oscar is disputed
one biography of bette davis claims that she named the oscar after her first husband band leader harmon oscar nelson one of the earliest mentions in print of the term oscar dates back to a time magazine article about the 1934 6th academy awards
walt disney is also quoted as thanking the academy for his oscar as early as 1932
another claimed origin is that the academy s executive secretary margaret herrick first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette s reminding her of her uncle oscar a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce
columnist sidney skolsky was present during herrick s naming and seized the name in his byline employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette oscar
the trophy was officially dubbed the oscar in 1939 by the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences
it may also have been named after the famous irish playwright oscar wilde
ownership of oscar statuettes since 1950 the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the academy for us 1
if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the academy keeps the statuette
academy awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six figure sums
in december 2011 orson welles 1941 oscar for citizen kane best original screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy
on december 20 2011 it sold in an online auction for us 861 542
while the oscar is owned by the recipient it is essentially not on the open market
michael todd s grandson tried to sell todd s oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989 but the academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction
although some oscar sales transactions have been successful some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy which keeps them in its treasury
nomination since 2004 academy award nomination results have been announced to the public in late january
prior to that the results were announced in early february
voters the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ampas a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of 5 783
academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production
actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering 1 311 members 22 percent of the academy s composition
votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and its predecessor price waterhouse for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies
all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors on behalf of academy branch executive committees
membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures
new membership proposals are considered annually
the academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join
the 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6 000 voting members
while the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then
in may 2011 the academy sent a letter advising its 6 000 or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting will be implemented in 2013
rules according to rules 2 and 3 of the official academy awards rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of january 1 to midnight at the end of december 31 in los angeles county california to qualify except for the best foreign language film
for example the 2009 best picture winner the hurt locker was actually first released in 2008 but did not qualify for the 2008 awards as it did not play its oscar qualifying run in los angeles until mid 2009 thus qualifying for the 2009 awards
rule 2 states that a film must be feature length defined as a minimum of 40 minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frame s or 48 frame s progressive scan digital cinema format with native resolution not less than 1280x720
producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year
the form includes the production credits for all related categories
then each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases
in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around 6000 active members
for most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories i e only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc
there are some exceptions in the case of certain categories like foreign film documentary and animated feature film in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches
in the special case of best picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category
foreign films must include english subtitles and each country can submit only one film per year
the members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for best picture
the winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories including best picture
ceremony telecast the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony most commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees
it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year
this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day
black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow tie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this
the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast
the academy awards is televised live across the united states excluding hawaii they aired live in alaska starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996 canada the united kingdom and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world
the 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million americans
other awards ceremonies such as the emmys golden globes and grammys are broadcast live in the east coast but are on tape delay in the west coast and might not air on the same day outside north america if the awards are even televised
the academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources
the awards show was first televised in 1953 on nbc which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the abc network took over televising the festivities through 1970 after which nbc resumed the broadcasts
abc once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 and it is under contract to do so through the year 2020
after more than 60 years of being held in late march or early april the ceremonies were moved up to late february or early march starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry
another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success of the ncaa men s division i basketball championship which would cut into the academy awards audience
the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period
some years the ceremony is moved into early march in deference to the winter olympics
advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast
the awards show holds the distinction of having won the most emmys in history with 47 wins and 195 nominations
after many years of being held on mondays at 9 00 pm eastern 6 00 p m pacific in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to sundays at 8 30 pm eastern 5 30 pm pacific
the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier
for many years the film industry had opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office
on march 30 1981 the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington d c in 1993 an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members
this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names
in 2010 the organizers of the academy awards announced that winners acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds
this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion
the academy has also had recent discussions about moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industry s long awards season
but such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail
also a january ceremony may have to compete with national football league playoff games
awards ceremonies the following is a listing of all academy awards ceremonies
historically the oscarcast has pulled in a bigger haul when box office hits are favored to win the best picture trophy
more than 57 25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th academy awards in 1998 the year of titanic which generated close to us 600 million at the north american box office pre oscars
the 76th academy awards ceremony in which the lord of the rings the return of the king pre telecast box office earnings of us 368 million received 11 awards including best picture drew 43 56 million viewers
the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date however was the 42nd academy awards best picture midnight cowboy which drew a 43 4 household rating on april 7 1970
by contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings
the 78th academy awards which awarded low budgeted independent film crash with a pre oscar gross of us 53 4 million generated an audience of 38 64 million with a household rating of 22 91
in 2008 the 80th academy awards telecast was watched by 31 76 million viewers on average with an 18 66 household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date in spite of celebrating 80 years of the academy awards
the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film no country for old men
venues in 1929 the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel
from 1930 – 1943 the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles
grauman s chinese theater in hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946 followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from 1947 to 1948
the 21st academy awards in 1949 were held at the academy award theater at what was the academy s headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood
from 1950 to 1960 the awards were presented at hollywood s pantages theatre
with the advent of television the 1953 – 1957 awards took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york first at the nbc international theatre 1953 and then at the nbc century theatre 1954 – 1957 after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles
the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica california in 1961
by 1969 the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to los angeles this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center
in 2002 the kodak theatre became the permanent home of the award ceremonies
however due to eastman kodak s bankruptcy issues this theatre was renamed the hollywood and highland center in the days preceding the february 26 2012 awards ceremony
as of may 2012 the theatre was once again renamed – to the dolby theatre – after dolby laboratories acquired the naming rights
merit categories current categories in the first year of the awards the best director award was split into two separate categories drama and comedy
at times the best original score award has also been split into separate categories drama and comedy musical
from the 1930s through the 1960s the art direction now production design cinematography and costume design awards were likewise split into two separate categories black and white films and color films
prior to 2012 the production design award was called art direction while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup
another award entitled the academy award for best original musical is still in the academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued
however due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year it has not been awarded since 1984 when purple rain won
discontinued categories proposed categories the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories
to date the following proposed categories have been rejected special categories the special academy awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the academy membership as a whole
they are not always presented on a consistent annual basis
current special categories discontinued special categories criticism due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season
this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than quality
william friedkin an academy award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in 2009 describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself
in addition some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars
the first to do so was dudley nichols best writing in 1935 for the informer
nichols boycotted the 8th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild
george c scott became the second person to refuse his award best actor in 1970 for patton at the 43rd academy awards ceremony
scott described it as a meat parade saying i do n t want any part of it
the third winner marlon brando refused his award best actor in 1972 for the godfather citing the film industry s discrimination and mistreatment of native americans
at the 45th academy awards ceremony brando sent sacheen littlefeather to read a 15 page speech detailing his criticisms
tim dirks editor of amc s filmsite org has written of the academy awards acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons personal popularity atonement for past mistakes or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominee s entire body of work

international atomic time tai from the french name temps atomique international is a high precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on earth s geoid
it is the basis for coordinated universal time utc which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earth s surface and for terrestrial time which is used for astronomical calculations
since 30 june 2012 when the last leap second was added tai has been exactly 35 seconds ahead of utc
the 35 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972 plus 25 leap second s in utc since 1972
time coordinates on the tai scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth
specifically both julian date s and the gregorian calendar are used
tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of 1958 and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the earth
operation tai as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 200 atomic clock s in over 50 national laboratories worldwide
the clocks are compared using gps signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer
due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone see signal averaging for a discussion
the majority of the clocks are caesium clocks the definition of the si second is written in terms of caesium
the participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with timecode s which is their estimate of tai
time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by a well known integer number of seconds
these time scales are denoted in the form utc npl in the utc form where npl in this case identifies the national physical laboratory uk
the tai form may be denoted tai npl
the latter is not to be confused with ta npl which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else
the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other
the international bureau of weights and measures bipm france combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible
this combined time scale is published monthly in circular t and is the canonical tai
this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc utc k equivalent to tai tai k for each participating institution k the same circular also gives tables of tai ta k for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales
errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular t aside from this once published in circular t the tai scale is not revised
in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale
doing so does not create another version of tai it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time tt
history early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously
atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955 using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk npl
the greenwich atomic ga scale began in 1955 at the royal greenwich observatory
the international time bureau bih began a time scale tm or am in july 1955 using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals
the united states naval observatory began the a 1 scale 13 september 1956 using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbs a scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado
both the bih scale and a 1 was defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958 it was set to read julian date 2436204 5 1 january 1958 00 00 00 at the corresponding ut2 instant
the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed a3 in 1963 and ta bih in 1969
this synchronisation was inevitably imperfect depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of ut2
at the time ut2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second
in 1961 utc began
utc is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time the discontinuities being arranged so that utc approximated ut2 until the end of 1971 and ut1 thereafter
this was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale a linear transformation of the bih s atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised while approximating ut1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts
the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967 and in 1971 the name international atomic time tai was assigned to a time scale based on si seconds with no leap seconds
in the 1970s it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitude s of the various clocks
starting from julian date 2443144 5 1 january 1977 00 00 00 corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid
because the clocks had been on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed down by about 10 − 12
the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal echelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale
the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg and terrestrial time tt
all three of these time scales were defined to read jd 2443144 5003725 1 january 1977 00 00 32 184 exactly at that instant
the offset is to provide continuity with the older ephemeris time
tai was henceforth a realisation of tt with the equation tt tai tai 32 184 s the continued existence of tai was questioned in a 2007 letter from the bipm to the itu r which stated in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc

altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others
it is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions
altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness
altruism can be distinguished from feelings of duty and loyalty
altruism is a motivation to provide something of value to a party who must be anyone but one s self while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual e g a god a king or collective e g a government
pure altruism consists of sacrificing something for someone other than the self e g sacrificing time energy or possessions with no expectation of any compensation or benefits either direct or indirect e g receiving recognition for the act of giving
much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible
the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification
the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits
the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others
used in this sense it s usually contrasted to egoism which is defined as acting to the benefit of one s self
the notion of altruism the concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought
the term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists
whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism
in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them
scientific viewpoints anthropology marcel mauss s book the gift contains a passage note on alms
this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice
in it he writes alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of a notion of sacrifice on the other
generosity is an obligation because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it
this is the ancient morality of the gift which has become a principle of justice
the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children
evolutionary explanations in the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor
in evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public good s and environmentalism
theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins
two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from game theory
some of the proposed mechanisms are such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts
instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors
every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment
this need not imply that on average 50 or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits
the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups
research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no kin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non competitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup
the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r price s development of the price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution
an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime mould s such as dictyostelium mucoroides
these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body
selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate long term high cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success
such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left wing politics such by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his 1902 book mutual aid a factor of evolution and peter singer in his book a darwinian left
most recently jeremy griffith has proposed a biological theory for the development of truly altruistic instincts that accommodates the biological imperative to reproduce as evidenced by a moral conscience visible in humans today
neurobiology jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labs d or hospital network j m provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging
in their research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october 2006 they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex
however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex septal region
these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species
altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hard wired and pleasurable
another experiment funded by the national institutes of health and conducted in 2007 at the duke university in durham north carolina suggests a different view that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it
in the study published in the february 2007 print issue of nature neuroscience researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish people
the researchers invited 45 volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game
in some rounds the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteer s choice
during these activities the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri scans of the participants brains and were surprised by the results
although they were expecting to see activity in the brain s reward centers based on the idea that people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it what they found was that another part of the brain was also involved and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone else s gain
that part of the brain is called the posterior superior temporal cortex pstc
in the next stage the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours
they then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a person s tendency to act altruistically and compared each person s level of altruism against their fmri brain scan
the results showed that pstc activity rose in proportion to a person s self reported level of altruism
according to the researchers the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it
we believe that the ability to perceive other people s actions as meaningful is critical for altruism said lead study investigator dharol tankersley
psychology the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing another ’s welfare
psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase one ’s own welfare
there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism
some definitions specify a self sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors
however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question
the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits outweigh costs
daniel batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory
he identified four major motives for altruism altruism to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism
altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy induced altruism can be genuinely selfless
the empathy altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering
feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions
people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another s suffering
helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues
in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service
research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person s distress
research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the bystander effect
greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility
however a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders
many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well being
in a study of older adults those who volunteered were significantly higher on life satisfaction and will to live and significantly lower in depression anxiety and somatization
volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well
one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30 year period and found that 52 of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36 of those who did volunteer experienced one
a study on adults ages 55 found that during the four year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63 lower likelihood of dying
after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44 reduction in mortality
merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well being
a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness
it is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite direction — that happier people are also kinder
the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional
studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states
studies have also been careful to note that feeling over taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness
for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant
additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others
studies suggest that gratitude goes hand in hand with kindness and is also very important for our well being
a study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that “ a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and well being
” sociology sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society altruism morality and social solidarity
american sociological association
the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro social altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field
the american sociology association asa acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable altruism morality and social solidarity asa
this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies
how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society
religious viewpoints most if not all of the world s religion s promote altruism as a very important moral value
buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality
buddhism altruism figures prominently in buddhism
love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering
many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion
these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being dalai lama
since all beings includes the individual love and compassion in buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other
it is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering
in practical terms however since most of us are spontaneously self centered buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others and thus can be characterized as altruistic
many would agree with the dalai lama that buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others
still the notion of altruism is modified in such a world view since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well being becomes dalai lama
in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect
a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what i cause if i cause suffering then as a natural consequence i will experience suffering if i cause happiness then as a natural consequence i will experience happiness
in buddhism karma pāli kamma is strictly distinguished from vipāka meaning fruit or result
karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause pāli hetu in the chain of cause and effect where it comprises the elements of volitional activities pali sankhara and action pali bhava
any action is understood to create seeds in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results pāli vipaka when they meet the right conditions
most types of karmas with good or bad results will keep one in the wheel of samsāra others will liberate one to nirvāna
buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action
motivation usually makes the difference between good and bad but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance so a well intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be bad in that it creates unpleasant results for the actor
in buddhism karma is not the only cause of all that happens
as taught in the early texts the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories known as niyama dhammas jainism the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings
jainism preaches the view of ahimsa – to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings i e uncompromising reverence for all life
it also considers all living things to be equal
the first thirthankar rishabh introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non violence and compassion for all living things
jainism prescribes a path of non violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal
jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action
the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks
they are a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors
one s unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans
anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything
jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride ego by humility deceit by straight forwardness and greed by contentment
the principle of non violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul
jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha param atma – highest soul
because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in one s actions
jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small
this policy extends even to microscopic organisms
jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders
the great vows mahavrata are prescribed for monks and limited vows anuvrata are prescribed for householders
in other words the house holders are encouraged to practice the five cardinal principles of non violence truthfulness non stealing celibacy and non possessiveness with their current practical limitations while the monks have to observe them very strictly
with consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress
christianity altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the gospel especially in the sermon on the mount and the sermon on the plain
from biblical to medieval christian traditions tensions between self affirmation and other regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of disinterested love as in the pauline phrase love seeks not its own interests
in his book indoctrination and self deception roderick hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self affirmation and altruism by analysis of other regard within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many
love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each person s experience and practice from within
as in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection
st thomas aquinas in the summa theologica ii ii quaestio 25 article 4 states that we should love our neighbour more than our ourselves
his interpretation of the pauline phrase is that we should seek the common good more than the private good but this is because the common good is a more desirable good for the individual
st thomas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself from leviticus 19 and matthew 22 as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others
however he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily life — since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being
in coining the word altruism as stated above comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism
many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god
1 john 4 states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of one s fellowman is the same as hatred of god
thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love
an altruistic action is not always a loving action
oord defines altruism as acting for the other s good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one s own good when the other s demands undermine overall well being
german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak
one way is a sincere expression of christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of one ’s own life and existence
another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people ’s business
at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse
islam and sufism in sufism the concept īṯār altruism is the notion of preferring others to oneself
for sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one s own concerns
the importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good islam considers those practicing īṯār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility
this is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that european concept in i thar attention is focused on everything in existence
a constant concern for allah i e god results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world
this concept was emphasized by sufi mystics like rabia al adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to allah i e god and dedication to people
thirteenth century turkish sufi poet yunus emre explained this philosophy as yaratılanı severiz yaratandan ötürü or we love the creature because of the creator
for many muslims i thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific islamic holidays
however i thar is also still an islamic ideal to which all muslims should strive to adhere at all times
judaism judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation
the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity
this is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism
this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god
kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence
rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force
modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework
ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another
ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity
sikhism altruism is essential to the sikh religion
the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness
the fifth nanak guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth
the ninth nanak guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity
in the late 17th century guru gobind singh ji the tenth guru in sikhism was in war with the moghul rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy
he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield
some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy
sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh ji and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield
what were you doing and why
asked the guru
i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya
the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds
you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru
it was under the tutelage of the guru that bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism
this volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same
hinduism advaita vedanta differs from the view that karma is a law of cause and effect but instead additionally hold that karma is mediated by the will of a personal supreme god
this view of karma is in contradiction to buddhism jainism and other indian religions that do view karma as a law of cause and effect
swami sivananda an advaita scholar reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the brahma sutras a vedantic text
in his commentary on chapter 3 of the brahma sutras sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short lived and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed
hence karma can not bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one s merit
furthermore one can not argue that karma generates apurva or punya which gives fruit
since apurva is non sentient it can not act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god
it can not independently bestow reward or punishment
philosophy there exists a wide range of philosophical views on man s obligations or motivations to act altruistically
proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically
the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self interest
both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which is the view that every individual s well being including one s own is of equal moral importance
a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own self interest and that true altruism is impossible
rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one s self interest without specifying how this affects one s moral obligations

ayn rand born alisa zinov yevna rosenbaum – march 6 1982 was a russian american novelist philosopher playwright and screenwriter
she is known for her two best selling novels the fountainhead and atlas shrugged and for developing a philosophical system she called objectivism
born and educated in russia rand moved to the united states in 1926
she worked as a screenwriter in hollywood and had a play produced on broadway in 1935 – 1936
after two early novels that were initially less successful she achieved fame with her 1943 novel the fountainhead
in 1957 she published her best known work the novel atlas shrugged
afterward she turned to nonfiction to promote her philosophy publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982
rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion
she supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected ethical altruism
in politics she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism instead supporting a minarchist limited government and laissez faire capitalism which she believed was the only social system that protected individual rights
in art rand promoted romantic realism
she was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her except for some aristotelians and classical liberals
rand s fiction was poorly received by many literary critics and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy
the objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas both to the public and in academic settings
she has been a significant influence among libertarians and american conservatives
life early life rand was born alisa zinov yevna rosenbaum on february 2 1905 to a bourgeois family living in saint petersburg
she was the eldest of the three daughters of zinovy zakharovich rosenbaum and his wife anna borisovna née kaplan largely non observant jews
zinovy rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located
rand found school unchallenging and said she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten
she was twelve at the time of the february revolution of 1917 during which she favored alexander kerensky over tsar nicholas ii
the subsequent october revolution and the rule of the bolshevik s under vladimir lenin disrupted the comfortable life the family had previously enjoyed
her father ’s pharmacy business was confiscated and the family displaced
they fled to the crimea which was initially under control of the white army during the russian civil war
she later recalled that while in high school she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue
after graduating from high school in the crimea at 16 rand returned with her family to petrograd the new name for saint petersburg where they faced desperate conditions on occasion nearly starving
after the russian revolution universities were opened to women allowing rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at petrograd state university where she studied in the department of social pedagogy majoring in history
at the university she was introduced to the writings of aristotle and plato who would be her greatest influence and counter influence respectively
a third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was friedrich nietzsche
able to read french german and russian rand also discovered the writers fyodor dostoevsky victor hugo edmond rostand and friedrich schiller who became her perennial favorites
along with many other bourgeois students rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating
however after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate which rand did in october 1924
she subsequently studied for a year at the state technicum for screen arts in leningrad
for one of her assignments she wrote an essay about the polish actress pola negri which became her first published work
by this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be rand possibly as a cyrillic contraction of her birth surname and she adopted the first name ayn either from a finnish name or from the hebrew word ayin meaning eye
arrival in america in 1925 rand was granted a visa to visit american relatives
she was so impressed with the skyline of manhattan upon her arrival in new york harbor that she cried what she later called tears of splendor
intent on staying in the united states to become a screenwriter she lived for a few months with relatives in chicago one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free
she then set out for hollywood california
initially rand struggled in hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses
a chance meeting with famed director cecil b demille led to a job as an extra in his film the king of kings as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter
while working on the king of kings she met an aspiring young actor frank o connor the two were married on april 15 1929
rand became an american citizen in 1931
taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at rko studios
she made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the united states but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate
early fiction rand s first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay red pawn to universal studios in 1932 although it was never produced
this was followed by the courtroom drama night of january 16th first produced by e e clive in hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on broadway in 1935
each night the jury was selected from members of the audience and one of the two different endings depending on the jury s verdict would then be performed
in 1941 paramount pictures produced a movie version of the play
rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result
rand s first novel the semi autobiographical we the living was published in 1936
set in soviet russia it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state
in a 1959 foreword to the novel rand stated that we the living is as near to an autobiography as i will ever write
it is not an autobiography in the literal but only in the intellectual sense
the plot is invented the background is not initial sales were slow and the american publisher let it go out of print although european editions continued to sell
after the success of her later novels rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies
without rand s knowledge or permission the novel was made into a pair of italian films noi vivi and addio kira in 1942
rediscovered in the 1960s these films were re edited into a new version which was approved by rand and re released as we the living in 1986
her novella anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel the fountainhead
it presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word i has been forgotten and replaced with we
it was published in england in 1938 but rand initially could not find an american publisher
as with we the living rand s later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946 which has sold more than 3 5 million copies
the fountainhead and political activism during the 1940s rand became politically active
both she and her husband worked full time in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of republican wendell willkie
this work led to rand s first public speaking experiences including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from new york city audiences who had just viewed pro willkie newsreels an experience she greatly enjoyed
this activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free market capitalism
she became friends with journalist henry hazlitt and his wife and hazlitt introduced her to the austrian school economist ludwig von mises
despite her philosophical differences with them rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and both of them expressed admiration for her
once mises referred to rand as the most courageous man in america a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said man instead of woman
rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer isabel paterson
rand questioned the well informed paterson about american history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book the god of the machine
rand s first major success as a writer came with the fountainhead in 1943 a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years
the novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named howard roark and his struggle against what rand described as second handers — those who attempt to live through others placing others above self
it was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the bobbs merrill company on the insistence of editor archibald ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it
while completing the novel rand was prescribed the amphetamine benzedrine to fight fatigue
the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel but when the book was done she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest
her continued use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings
the fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success bringing rand fame and financial security
in 1943 rand sold the rights for a film version to warner bros and she returned to hollywood to write the screenplay
finishing her work on that screenplay she was hired by producer hal wallis as a screenwriter and script doctor
her work for wallis included the screenplays for the oscar nominated love letters and you came along
this role gave rand time to work on other projects including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called the moral basis of individualism
although the planned book was never completed a condensed version was published as an essay titled the only path to tomorrow in the january 1944 edition of reader s digest magazine
while working in hollywood rand extended her involvement with free market and anti communist activism
she became involved with the motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals a hollywood anti communist group and wrote articles on the group s behalf
she also joined the anti communist american writers association
a visit by isabel paterson to meet with rand s california associates led to a final falling out between the two when paterson made comments that rand saw as rude to valued political allies
in 1947 during the second red scare rand testified as a friendly witness before the united states house un american activities committee
her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the soviet union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film song of russia
rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the soviet union portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was
she wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film the best years of our lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but she was not allowed to testify about it
when asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations rand described the process as futile
after several delays the film version of the fountainhead was released in 1949
although it used rand s screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end complaining about its editing acting and other elements
atlas shrugged and objectivism in the years following the publication of the fountainhead rand received numerous letters from readers some of whom it profoundly influenced
in 1951 rand moved from los angeles to new york city where she gathered a group of these admirers around her
this group jokingly designated the collective included future federal reserve chairman alan greenspan a young psychology student named nathan blumenthal later nathaniel branden and his wife barbara and barbara s cousin leonard peikoff
at first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy
later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel atlas shrugged as the manuscript pages were written
in 1954 rand s close relationship with the younger nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair with the consent of their spouses
atlas shrugged published in 1957 was rand s magnum opus
rand described the theme of the novel as the role of the mind in man s existence — and as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational self interest
it advocates the core tenets of rand s philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement
the plot involves a dystopia n united states in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy
the novel s hero and leader of the strike john galt describes the strike as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation s wealth and achievement
with this fictional strike rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive the economy would collapse and society would fall apart
the novel includes elements of romance mystery and science fiction and it contains rand s most extensive statement of objectivism in any of her works of fiction a lengthy monologue delivered by galt
despite many negative reviews atlas shrugged became an international bestseller and in an interview with mike wallace rand declared herself the most creative thinker alive
after completing the novel rand fell into a severe depression
atlas shrugged was rand s last completed work of fiction a turning point in her life it marked the end of rand s career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher
in 1958 nathaniel branden established nathaniel branden lectures later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute nbi to promote rand s philosophy
collective members gave lectures for nbi and wrote articles for objectivist periodicals that she edited
rand later published some of these articles in book form
critics including some former nbi students and branden himself have described the culture of nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand with some describing nbi or the objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion
rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair and some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers
rand was unimpressed with many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her
however some former nbi students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated with the problem being concentrated among rand s closest followers in new york
later years throughout the 1960s and 1970s rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as yale princeton columbia harvard and mit
she received an honorary doctorate from lewis clark college in 1963
she also began delivering annual lectures at the ford hall forum responding afterward to questions from the audience
during these speeches and q a sessions she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day
these included supporting abortion rights opposing the vietnam war and the military draft but condemning many draft dodgers as bums supporting israel in the arab israeli war of 1973 against palestinians and arabs as civilized men fighting savages saying european colonists had the right to take land from american indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws against it
she also endorsed several republican candidates for president of the united states most strongly barry goldwater in 1964 whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for the objectivist newsletter
in 1964 nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott whom he later married
nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand
when she learned of it in 1968 though her romantic relationship with branden had already ended rand terminated her relationship with both brandens which led to the closure of nbi
rand published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life
branden later apologized in an interview to every student of objectivism for perpetuating the ayn rand mystique and for contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the objectivist movement
in subsequent years rand and several more of her closest associates parted company
rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking
in 1976 she retired from writing her newsletter and despite her initial objections was persuaded to allow evva pryor a consultant from her attorney s office to sign her up for social security and medicare
during the late 1970s her activities within the objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on november 9 1979
one of her final projects was work on a never completed television adaptation of atlas shrugged
rand died of heart failure on march 6 1982 at her home in new york city and was interred in the kensico cemetery valhalla new york
rand s funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including alan greenspan
a six foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket
in her will rand named leonard peikoff the heir to her estate
philosophy rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute
she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and esthetics
in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion
in epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man s senses
she rejected all claims of non perceptual or a priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing
in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented a theory of concept formation and endorsed the rejection of the analytic – synthetic dichotomy
in ethics rand argued for rational egoism rational self interest as the guiding moral principle
she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself
she referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in which she presented her solution to the is ought problem by describing a meta ethical theory that based morality in the needs of man s survival qua man
she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites
rand s political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights and she considered laissez faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights
she opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship
rand believed that rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government
although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian she preferred the term radical for capitalism
she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics
she denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism
she rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice
rand s esthetics defined art as a selective re creation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgments
according to rand art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness
as a writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will
she described her own approach to literature as romantic realism
rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three a s — aristotle aquinas and ayn rand
indeed her debt to aristotle was so great that in a 1959 interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle who is the only philosopher who ever influenced me
i devised the rest of my philosophy myself
however she also found early inspiration in friedrich nietzsche and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from rand s journals in passages from the first edition of we the living which rand later revised and in her overall writing style
however by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsche s ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed
among the philosophers rand held in particular disdain was immanuel kant whom she referred to as a monster although philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued that she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences
rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts her ethics and her discovery in politics that evil — the violation of rights — consists of the initiation of force
she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating i am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and i am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason
if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows
reception and legacy reviews during rand s lifetime her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation
rand s first novel we the living was admired by the literary critic h l mencken her broadway play night of january 16th was both a critical and popular success and the fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in the new york times as masterful
rand s novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic
however they became bestseller s largely through word of mouth
the first reviews rand received were for night of january 16th
reviews of the production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer
rand believed that her first novel we the living was not widely reviewed but rand scholar michael s berliner says it was the most reviewed of any of her works with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications
overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work
her 1938 novella anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re issues
rand s first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixed
there was a positive review in the new york times that rand greatly appreciated
the reviewer called rand a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time
there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications
some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel such as one that called it a whale of a book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper rationing
other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and rand s style offensively pedestrian
rand s 1957 novel atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative
in the national review conservative author whittaker chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly
he described the tone of the book as shrillness without reprieve and accused rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of the soviets claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged a voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding to a gas chamber — go
atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer john chamberlain but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put downs calling it execrable claptrap and a nightmare they said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity
author flannery o connor wrote in a letter to a friend that the fiction of ayn rand is as low as you can get re fiction
i hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail
rand s nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had
the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged with philosopher sidney hook likening her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality
her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers
on the 100th anniversary of rand s birth in 2005 edward rothstein writing for the new york times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neo romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society
in 2007 book critic leslie clark described her fiction as romance novels with a patina of pseudo philosophy
in 2009 gq s critic columnist tom carson described her books as capitalism s version of middlebrow religious novels such as ben hur and the left behind series
popular interest in 1991 a survey conducted for the library of congress and the book of the month club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent s life was
rand s atlas shrugged was the second most popular choice after the bible
rand s books continue to be widely sold and read with 25 million copies sold as of 2007 and another 500 000 sold and 300 000 donated by the ayn rand institute in 2008
although rand s influence has been greatest in the united states there has been international interest in her work
rand s work continues to be among the top sellers among books in india
rand s contemporary admirers included fellow novelists such as ira levin kay nolte smith and l neil smith and later writers such as erika holzer and terry goodkind have been influenced by her
other artists who have cited rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist steve ditko and musician neil peart of rush
rand provided a positive view of business and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work
john allison of bb t and ed snider of comcast spectacor have funded the promotion of rand s ideas while mark cuban owner of the dallas mavericks and john p mackey ceo of whole foods among others have said they consider rand crucial to their success
rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media on television shows including animated sitcoms live action comedies dramas and game shows as well as in movies and video games
she or characters based on her figure prominently in positive and negative lights in literary and science fiction novels by prominent american authors
nick gillespie editor in chief of reason has remarked that rand s is a tortured immortality one in which she s as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist and that jibes at rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture
two movies have been made about rand s life
a 1997 documentary film ayn rand a sense of life was nominated for the academy award for documentary feature
the passion of ayn rand a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name won several awards
rand s image also appears on a u s postage stamp designed by artist nick gaetano
political influence although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian rand has had continuing influence on right wing politics and libertarianism
jim powell a senior fellow at the cato institute considers rand one of the three most important women along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson of modern american libertarianism and david nolan one of the founders of the libertarian party stated that without ayn rand the libertarian movement would not exist
in his history of the libertarian movement journalist brian doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large and biographer jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right
she faced intense opposition from william f buckley jr and other contributors for the national review magazine
they published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by whittaker chambers garry wills and m stanton evans
nevertheless her influence among conservatives forced buckley and other national review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism
the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the united states republican party despite rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives such as being pro choice and an atheist
a 1987 article in the new york times referred to her as the reagan administration s novelist laureate
republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels
the late 2000s financial crisis spurred renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis and opinion articles compared real world events with the plot of the novel
during this time signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests
there was also increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan
for example mother jones remarked that rand s particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy the talented and the powerful as the oppressed while the nation alleged similarities between the moral syntax of randianism and fascism
academic reaction during rand s lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars
when the first academic book about rand s philosophy appeared in 1971 its author declared writing about rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously
a few articles about rand s ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982 many of them in the personalist
one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who argued that her meta ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is – ought problem posed by david hume
some responses to nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in the personalist arguing that nozick misstated rand s case
academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited
academic mimi gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about rand s novels when she began researching her in 1973 and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s
since rand s death interest in her work has gradually increased
historian jennifer burns has identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in rand the most recent of which is an explosion of scholarship since the year 2000
however few universities currently include rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study
gladstein chris matthew sciabarra allan gotthelf edwin a locke and tara smith have taught her work in academic institutions
sciabarra co edits the journal of ayn rand studies a nonpartisan peer reviewed journal dedicated to the study of rand s philosophical and literary work
in 1987 gotthelf helped found the ayn rand society with george walsh and david kelley and has been active in sponsoring seminars about rand and her ideas
smith has written several academic books and papers on rand s ideas including ayn rand s normative ethics the virtuous egoist a volume on rand s ethical theory published by cambridge university press
rand s ideas have also been made subjects of study at clemson and duke universities
scholars of english and american literature have largely ignored her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s
rand scholars douglas den uyl and douglas b rasmussen while stressing the importance and originality of her thought describe her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional
philosopher jack wheeler says that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rand s ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought
in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in 2001 john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation
in a 1999 interview in the chronicle of higher education sciabarra commented i know they laugh at rand while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community
philosopher michael huemer has argued that very few people find rand s ideas convincing especially her ethics which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence
he attributes the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist
thus atlas shrugged outsells not only the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism as ludwig von mises friedrich hayek or frederic bastiat but also rand s own non fiction works
political scientist charles murray while praising rand s literary accomplishments criticizes her claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche
according to murray by insisting that objectivism had sprung full blown from her own mind with just a little help from aristotle rand was being childish as well as out of touch with reality
although rand maintained that objectivism was an integrated philosophical system philosopher robert h bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas
objectivist movement in 1985 rand s heir leonard peikoff established the ayn rand institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rand s ideas and works
in 1990 philosopher david kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies now known as the atlas society
in 2001 historian john mccaskey organized the anthem foundation for objectivist scholarship which provides grants for scholarly work on objectivism in academia
the charitable foundation of bb t corporation has also given grants for teaching rand s ideas or works
the university of texas at austin the university of pittsburgh and university of north carolina at chapel hill are among the schools that have received grants
in some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to rand

algeria is a member of the african union the arab league opec and the united nations and is a founding member of the arab maghreb union
the territory of today s algeria was the home of many ancient prehistoric cultures including aterian and capsian cultures
its area has known many empires and dynasties including ancient berber numidia ns carthaginians romans vandals byzantines arab umayyad s berber fatimid s berber almoravids berber almohads and later turkish ottomans
etymology the country s name derives from the city of algiers
the most common etymology links the city name to al jazā ir الجزائر the islands a truncated form of the city s older name jazā ir banī mazghanna جزائر بني مزغنة islands of the mazghanna tribe employed by medieval geographers such as al idrisi
others trace it to ldzayer the maghrebi arabic and berber for algeria possibly related to the zirid dynasty king ziri ibn manad and founder of the city of algiers
history ancient history at ain hanech region saïda province early remnants 200 000 bc of hominid occupation in north africa were found
neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles 43 000 bc similar to those in the levant
algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques
tools of this era starting about 30 000 bc are called aterian after the archeological site of bir el ater south of tebessa
the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian located mainly in oran region
this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between 15 000 and 10 000 bc
neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghrib between 6000 and 2000 bc
this life richly depicted in the tassili n ajjer paintings predominated in algeria until the classical period
the amalgam of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa
from their principal center of power at carthage the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast by 600 bc a phoenicia n presence existed at tipasa east of cherchell hippo regius modern annaba and rusicade modern skikda
these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages
as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically
berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organization supported several states
trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others
by the early 4th century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army
in the revolt of the mercenaries berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war
they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthage s north african territory and they minted coins bearing the name libyan used in greek to describe natives of north africa
the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars
in 146 bc the city of carthage was destroyed
as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew
by the 2nd century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged
two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage
west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modern day morocco to the atlantic ocean
the high point of berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of massinissa in the 2nd century bc
after masinissa s death in 148 bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times
massinissa s line survived until 24 ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire
for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region
like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products
the vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in 429 and by 435 controlled coastal numidia
they did not make any significant settlement on the land
the region was later recaptured by the eastern roman empire which ruled it until the muslim conquest in the 7th century
middle ages when muslim arabs arrived in algeria in the mid 7th century a large number of locals converted to the new faith
after the fall of the umayyad arab dynasty in 751 numerous local berber dynasties emerged
amongst those dynasties were the aghlabids almohads abdalwadid zirids rustamids hammadids almoravids and the fatimids
converted the berber kutama of the petite kabylie to its cause the shia fatimid s overthrew the rustamid s and conquered egypt leaving algeria and tunisia to their zirid vassals
when the latter rebelled the shia fatimids sent in the banu hilal and banu sulaym arabian tribes who unexpectedly defeated the zirid s the berber people controlled much of the maghreb region throughout the middle ages
the berbers were made up of several tribes
the two main branches were the botr and barnès tribes who were divided into tribes and again into sub tribes
each region of the maghreb contained several tribes for example sanhadja houaras zenata masmouda kutama awarba and berghwata
all these tribes were independent and made territorial decisions
several berber dynasties emerged during the middle ages in maghreb sudan andalusia sicily mali niger senegal egypt and other nearby lands
ibn khaldun provides a table summarizing the zirid banu ifran maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid abdalwadid wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynasties
in the early 16th century spain constructed fortified outposts presidio s on or near the algerian coast
spain took control of mers el kebir in 1505 oran in 1509 and tlemcen mostaganem and ténès in 1510
in the same year the merchants of algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to spain which built a fort on it
the presidios in north africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for spain s merchant fleet
ottoman algeria in 1516 the muslim privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers
when aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers
the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2 000 janissaries
with the aid of this force hayreddin subdued the coastal region between constantine and oran although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until 1791
the next beylerbey was hayreddin s son hasan who assumed the position in 1544
until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits
subsequently with the institution of a regular ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for three year terms
the pasha was assisted by janissaries known in algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha
discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid 1600s because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha
as a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659
plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa
algiers lost from 30 000 to 50 000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620 – 21 and suffered high fatalities in 1654 – 57 1665 1691 and 1740 – 42
in 1671 the taifa rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power
the new leader received the title of dey
after 1689 the right to select the dey passed to the divan a council of some sixty notables
it was at first dominated by the ojaq but by the 18th century it had become the dey s instrument
in 1710 the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role
although algiers remained a part of the ottoman empire the ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there
the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat
the dey was elected for a life term but in the 159 years 1671 – 1830 that the system survived fourteen of the twenty nine deys were assassinated
despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the day to day operation of government was remarkably orderly
although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest
autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regency s authority was seldom applied in the kabylie
privateers era the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other non islamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea
the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves
they also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives
according to robert davis from the 16th to 19th century pirates captured 1 million to 1 25 million europeans as slaves
they often made raids called razzia s on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and the ottoman empire
in 1544 hayreddin captured the island of ischia taking 4 000 prisoners and enslaved some 9 000 inhabitants of lipari almost the entire population
in 1551 turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo between 5 000 and 6 000 sending the captives to libya
in 1554 pirates sacked vieste in southern italy and took an estimated 7 000 captives as slaves
in 1558 barbary corsairs captured the town of ciutadella minorca destroyed it slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3 000 survivors as slaves to istanbul
barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands and in response the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churchesd
the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera
between 1609 to 1616 england lost 466 merchant ships to barbary pirates
in the 19th century the pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers paying a license tax in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels
one american slave reported that the algerians had enslaved 130 american seamen in the mediterranean and atlantic from 1785 to 1793
piracy on american vessels in the mediterranean resulted in the united states initiating the first 1801 – 1805 and second barbary war s 1815
following those wars algeria was weaker and europeans with an anglo dutch fleet commanded by the british lord exmouth attacked algiers
after a nine hour bombardment they obtained a treaty from the dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by decatur us navy concerning the demands of tributes
in addition the dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving christians
french algeria on the pretext of a slight to their consul the french invaded and captured algiers in 1830
the conquest of algeria by the french was long and resulted in considerable bloodshed
a combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous algerian population to decline by nearly one third from 1830 to 1872
the population of algeria which stood at about 1 5 million in 1830 reached nearly 11 million in 1960
french policy was predicated on civilizing the country although its literacy rate of 50 in 1830 according to some algerian historians exceeded that of france
algeria s social fabric suffered during the occupation literacy plummeted
during this period a small but influential french speaking indigenous elite was formed made up of berbers mostly from kabyles
in the french policy of divide to reign its government favored the kabyles
about 80 of indigenous schools were constructed for kabyles
from 1848 until independence france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and département of the nation
one of france s longest held overseas territories algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants who became known as colons and later as pieds noir s between 1825 and 1847 50 000 french people emigrated to algeria
these settlers benefited from the french government s confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land
gradually dissatisfaction among the muslim population which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france
tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began
historians have estimated that between 30 000 and 150 000 harkis and their dependents were killed by the front de libération nationale fln or by lynch mobs in algeria
the fln used terrorist attacks in algeria and france as part of its war and the french conducted severe reprisals and repression
the war concluded in 1962 when algeria gained complete independence following the march 1962 evian agreements and the july 1962 self determination referendum
independence algeria s first president was the fln leader ahmed ben bella
morocco s claim to portions of western algeria led to the sand war in 1963
ben bella was overthrown in 1965 by houari boumédienne his former ally and defense minister
under ben bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian boumédienne continued this trend
but he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role
he collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive
oil extraction facilities were nationalized
this was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisis
in the 1960s and 1970s under president houari boumediene algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a state controlled socialist economy
boumediene s successor chadli bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms
he promoted a policy of arabisation in algerian society and public life
teachers of arabic brought in from other muslim countries spread radical islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political islamism
the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut
economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in algerian social unrest during the 1980s by the end of the decade bendjedid introduced a multi party system
political parties developed such as the front islamique du salut fis a broad coalition of islamist groups
civil war and aftermath in december 1991 the front islamique du salut dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections
fearing the election of an islamist government the authorities intervened on 11 january 1992 cancelling the elections
bendjedid resigned and a high council of state was installed to act as presidency
it banned the fis triggering a civil insurgency between its armed wing the armed islamic group and the national armed forces in which more than 100 000 persons are thought to have died
the armed islamic group declared a ceasefire in october 1997
algeria held elections in 1999 which were won by president abdelaziz bouteflika
he worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a civil concord initiative approved in a referendum under which many political prisoners were pardoned and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty in force until 13 january 2000
the ais disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly
the groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat gspc a splinter group of the group islamic armée continued a terrorist campaign against the government
bouteflika was re elected in the april 2004 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation
the programme comprised economic institutional political and social reform to modernise the country raise living standards and tackle the causes of alienation
it also included a second amnesty initiative the charter for peace and national reconciliation which was approved in a referendum in september 2005
it offered amnesty to most guerrillas and government security forces
in november 2008 the algerian constitution was amended following a vote in parliament removing the two term limit on presidential incumbents
this change enabled bouteflika to stand for re election in the 2009 presidential elections and he was re elected in april 2009
during his election campaign and following his re election bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a 150 billion spending programme to create three million new jobs the construction of one million new housing units and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes
a continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 december 2010 inspired by similar protests across the middle east and north africa
on 24 february 2011 the government lifted algeria s 19 year old state of emergency
the government enacted legislation dealing with political parties the electoral code and the representation of women in elected bodies
in april 2011 bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform

its southern part includes a significant portion of the sahara
to the north the tell atlas form with the saharan atlas further south two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands
both atlas tend to merge in eastern algeria
the vast mountain ranges of aures and nememcha occupy the entire northeastern algeria and are delineated by the tunisian border
the highest point is mount tahat m
algeria lies mostly between latitudes 19 ° and 37 ° n a small area is north of 37 ° and longitudes 9 ° w and 12 ° e
most of the coastal area is hilly sometimes even mountainous and there are a few natural harbour s the area from the coast to the tell atlas is fertile
south of the tell atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the saharan atlas farther south there is the sahara desert
the ahaggar mountains also known as the hoggar are a highland region in central sahara southern algeria
they are located about south of the capital algiers and just west of tamanghasset
algiers oran constantine tizi ouzou and annaba are algeria s main cities
climate and hydrology in this region midday desert temperatures can be hot year round
after sunset however the clear dry air permits rapid loss of heat and the nights are cool to chilly
enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded
the highest official temperature was at in salah
rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the tell atlas ranging from annually the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east
precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern algeria where it reaches as much as in some years
farther inland the rainfall is less plentiful
prevailing winds that are easterly and north easterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from september through december a decrease in the late winter and spring months and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months
algeria also has ergs or sand dunes between mountains
among these in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty temperatures can get up to
fauna and flora the varied vegetation of algeria includes coastal mountainous and grassy desert like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife
many of the creatures comprising the algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization
the most commonly seen animals include the wild boar s jackal s and gazelle s although it is not uncommon to spot fennecs foxes and jerboas
algeria also has a few panther leopard and cheetah populations but these are seldom seen
a variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers
the forests are inhabited by boars and jackals
barbary macaque s are the sole native monkey
snake s monitor lizard s and numerous other reptile s can be found living among an array of rodent s throughout the semi arid regions of algeria
many animals are now extinct among which the barbary lion s and bears
in the north some of the native flora includes macchia scrub olive trees oak s cedar s and other conifers
the mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens aleppo pine juniper and evergreen oak and some deciduous trees
fig eucalyptus agave and various palm trees grow in the warmer areas
the grape vine is indigenous to the coast
in the sahara region some oases have palm trees
acacias with wild olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the sahara
camels are used extensively the desert also abounds with poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes scorpion s and numerous insects
politics algeria is an authoritarian regime according to the democracy index 2010
the freedom of the press 2009 report gives it rating not free
elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over algeria
instead a group of unelected civilian and military décideurs known as le pouvoir the power actually rule the country even deciding who should be president
the most powerful man may be mohamed mediène head of the military intelligence
in recent years many of these generals have died or retired
after the death of general larbi belkheir bouteflika put loyalists in key posts notably at sonatrach and secured constitutional amendments that make him re electable indefinitely
the head of state is the president of algeria who is elected for a five year term

foreign relations in october 2009 algeria cancelled a weapons deal with france over the possibility of inclusion of israeli parts in them
tensions between algeria and morocco in relation to the western sahara have been an obstacle to tightening the arab maghreb union nominally established in 1989 but which has carried little practical weight
military the military of algeria consists of the people s national army anp the algerian national navy mra and the algerian air force qjj plus the territorial air defense force
it is the direct successor of the armée de libération nationale aln the armed wing of the nationalist national liberation front which fought french colonial occupation during the algerian war of independence 1954 – 62
total military personnel include 147 000 active 150 000 reserve and 187 000 paramilitary staff 2008 estimate

provinces and districts algeria is divided into 48 provinces wilaya s 553 districts daïra s and 1 541 municipalities baladiyah s
each province district and municipality is named after its seat which is usually the largest city
the administrative divisions have changed several times since independence
when introducing new provinces the numbers of old provinces are kept hence the non alphabetical order
with their official numbers currently since 1983 they are economy algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the world bank
the economy remains dominated by the state a legacy of the country s socialist post independence development model
in recent years the algerian government has halted the privatization of state owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy
algeria has struggled to develop industries outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy
the government s efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages
the country is facing a number of short term and medium term problems including the need to diversify the economy strengthen political economic and financial reforms improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions
a wave of economic protests in february and march 2011 prompted the algerian government to offer more than 23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases
public spending has increased by 27 annually during the past five years
the 2010 – 14 public investment programme will cost us 286 billion 40 of which will go to human development
the algerian economy grew by 2 6 in 2011 driven by public spending in particular in the construction and public works sector and by growing internal demand
if hydrocarbons are excluded growth has been estimated at 4 8
growth of 3 1 is expected in 2012 rising to 4 2 in 2013
the rate of inflation was 3 9 and the budget deficit 3 of gdp
the current account surplus is estimated at 9 3 of gdp and at the end of december 2011 official reserves were put at us 182 2 billion
inflation the lowest in the region has remained stable at 4 on average between 2003 and 2007
in 2011 algeria announced a budgetary surplus of 26 93 billion 62 46 increase in comparison to 2010 surplus
in general the country exported 73 39 billion worth of commodities while it imported 46 45 billion
thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues algeria has a cushion of 173 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund
in addition algeria s external debt is extremely low at about 2 of gdp
the economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth and despite high foreign exchange reserves us 178 billion equivalent to three years of imports current expenditure growth makes algeria s budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues
in 2011 the agricultural sector and services recorded growth of 10 and 5 3 respectively
about 14 of the labor force are employed in the agricultural sector
fiscal policy in 2011 remained expansionist and made it possible to maintain the pace of public investment and to contain the strong demand for jobs and housing
algeria has not joined the wto despite several years of negotiations
in march 2006 russia agreed to erase 4 74 billion of algeria s soviet era debt during a visit by russian president vladimir putin to the country the first by a russian leader in half a century
in return algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika agreed to buy 7 5 billion worth of combat planes air defense systems and other arms from russia according to the head of russia s state arms exporter rosoboronexport
hydrocarbons algeria whose economy is reliant on petroleum has been an opec member since 1969
its crude oil production stands at around 1 1 million barrels day but it is also a major gas producer and exporter with important links to europe
hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy accounting for roughly 60 of budget revenues 30 of gdp and over 95 of export earnings
algeria has the 10th largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the sixth largest gas exporter
the u s energy information administration reported that in 2005 algeria had of proven natural gas reserves
it also ranks 16th in oil reserves
non hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5
to cope with social demands the authorities raised expenditure especially on basic food support employment creation support for smes and higher salaries
high hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position
income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices though the trend in production volume is downwards
production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume continues to decline dropping from 43 2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011
nevertheless the sector accounted for 98 of the total volume of exports in 2011 and 70 of budgetary receipts or usd 71 4 billion
the algerian national oil company is sonatrach which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in algeria
all foreign operators must work in partnership with sonatrach which usually has majority ownership in production sharing agreements
labour market despite a decline in total unemployment youth and women unemployment is high
unemployment particularly affects the young with a jobless rate of 21 5 among the 15 24 age group
the overall rate of unemployment was 10 in 2011 but remained higher among young people with a rate of 21 5 for those aged between 15 and 24

this is a list of characters in ayn rand s novel atlas shrugged
major characters the following are major characters from the novel
protagonists dagny taggartdagny taggart is the protagonist of the novel
she is vice president in charge of operations for taggart transcontinental under her brother james taggart
however due to james incompetence it is dagny who is responsible for all the workings of the railroad
dagny has three romantic relationships each with a man of ability francisco d anconia hank rearden and john galt
galt marks the pinnacle of everything dagny seeks in the world and is the kind of man alluded to in her youth when she imagines a man standing off in the distance at the end of a great set of railroad tracks and all her struggles
the essential drama of dagny s character is her struggle to reconcile the life she lives and the railroad which she loves with the moral code of those who wish to destroy it
she believes these destroyers simply want to heap burdens upon her for the sake of others which she has the ability to carry
like hank she believes they want to live but are too stupid and incompetent to realize how their duties and altruistic projects impede that goal
it is not until she sees the man most important to her in the world john galt strapped to a torture machine about to be killed by the looters who recognize too that he is the only man who can save them from economic collapse that she realizes that the moral code of the looters is one of death they recognize what is good and necessary for life but wish to destroy it anyway
she is a typical randian hero ine similar to dominique francon the fountainhead or kira argounova we the living
francisco d anconiafrancisco d anconia is one of the central characters in atlas shrugged and owner by inheritance of the world s largest copper mining empire
he is a childhood friend and the first love of dagny taggart
a child prodigy of exceptional talents francisco was dubbed the climax of the d anconia line an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists
he attended patrick henry university and was a classmate of john galt and ragnar danneskjöld and student of both hugh akston and robert stadler
he began working at a young age while still in school proving that he could have made a successful career on his own merits without the aid of his family s wealth and power
francisco is one of the strikers and is slowly destroying the d anconia empire to put it out of the raiders reach
his actions were designed both to trap looters into relying upon his worthless ventures in order to disrupt their schemes and to try to show the inevitable consequences of looting
he adopted the persona of a worthless playboy by which he is known to the world as an effective cover
however he is forced to give up dagny knowing that she would not be ready to join the strikers
he remains deeply in love with her throughout the book while also being a good and loyal friend of her other two lovers hank rearden and john galt
his full name is given as francisco domingo carlos andres sebastián d anconia
john galt the enigmatic john galt is the primary male hero of atlas shrugged
he initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for taggart transcontinental who often dines with eddie willers in the employee s cafeteria and leads eddie to reveal important information about dagny taggart and taggart transcontinental
only eddie s side of their conversations is given in the novel
eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors dagny is most dependent on these men are consistently the next to disappear
later in the novel the reader discovers this worker s true identity
before working for taggart transcontinental galt worked as an engineer for the twentieth century motor company
while there he invented his generator that produces electricity from static electricity in the environment
his prototype may or may not have been completed when he left due to the management deciding on a communistic pay system
this prototype was found by dagny when she and hank rearden made a trip to the long closed twentieth century motor factory
dagny would hire quenten daniels to try to figure out how the machine worked
galt would take over the radio airwaves during mr thompson s much heralded speech at the end of the book and give his long soliloquy
henry hank reardenhenry also known as hank is one of the central characters in atlas shrugged
like many of rand s capitalist characters he is a self made man
he owns the most important steel company in the united states
he invents rearden metal an alloy stronger than steel with similar properties to stainless steel
he lives in philadelphia with his wife lillian his brother philip and his elderly mother all of whom he supports
hank rearden knows something is wrong with the world but he is unable to define the problem
his friend francisco d anconia helps him understand and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in galt s speech
rearden also serves to illustrate rand s theory of sex
lillian rearden can not appreciate hank rearden s virtues and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex
dagny taggart clearly does appreciate rearden s virtues and this appreciation evolves into sexual desire
rearden is torn because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct but he responds sexually to dagny who represents his highest values
rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict and in doing so illustrates rand s sexual theory
eddie willersedwin eddie willers is the special assistant to the vice president in charge of operations at taggart transcontinental
he grew up with dagny taggart
his father and grandfather worked for the taggarts and he followed in their footsteps
he is completely loyal to dagny and to taggart transcontinental
he is also secretly in love with dagny
willers is generally assumed to represent the common man someone who does not possess the promethean creative ability of the strikers but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations
after dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive galt he does everything he can to keep the railroad running as the country falls apart
when the train he is riding on breaks down he tries in vain to repair it as the passengers and crew abandon him then collapses sobbing on the tracks
ragnar danneskjöldone of the original strikers he is now world famous as a privateer
ragnar attended patrick henry university and became friends with john galt and francisco d anconia while studying under hugh akston and robert stadler
danneskjöld seizes relief ships that are being sent from the united states to the people s states of europe
as the novel progresses danneskjöld begins to become active in american waters
danneskjöld s action is to restore to other creative people the money in gold which was unjustly taken away from them — specifically their income tax payments
he explains this is not altruism his motivation is to ensure that once those espousing galt s philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society they will have enough capital to rebuild the world
kept in the background for much of the book danneskjöld makes a personal appearance when he risks his life to meet hank rearden in the night and hand him a bar of gold as an advance payment to encourage rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation
danneskjöld is married to the actress kay ludlow their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world which only knows of ludlow as a film star who retired and dropped out of sight
it is mentioned that some of the strikers have strong reservations about his way of conducting the common struggle
according to barbara branden who was closely associated with rand at the time the book was written there were sections written describing danneskjöld s adventures at sea which were cut from the final published text
in a 1974 comment at a lecture ayn rand admitted that danneskjöld s name was a tribute to victor hugo
the hero of hugo s novel hans of iceland becomes the first of the counts of danneskjöld
in the published book danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others dagny taggart or hank rearden except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter
antagonists james taggartthe president of taggart transcontinental and the book s most important antagonist
taggart is an expert influence peddler who is however incapable of making operational decisions on his own
he relies on his sister dagny taggart to actually run the railroad but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor
in a sense he is the antithesis of dagny
as the novel progresses the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed it is a code of stagnation
the goal of this code is to not exist to not move forward to become a zero
taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal
he maintains his pretense that he wants to live and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself
this contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends and the horror that he will succeed at this
in the final chapters of the novel he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect
lillian reardenthe unsupportive wife of hank rearden
they have been married eight years as the novel begins
lillian is a frigid moocher who seeks to destroy her husband
she compares being rearden s wife with owning the world s most powerful horse
since she can not comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast she must bridle it down to her level even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be grievously wasted
lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is realistic enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts
she indicates that she abhors francisco d anconia because she believes he is a sexual adventurer
as her motives become more clear lillian is found to share the sentiments of many other moochers and their worship of destruction
her actions are explained as the desire to destroy achievement in the false belief that such an act bestows a greatness to the destroyer equal to the accomplishment destroyed
she seeks then to ruin rearden in an effort to prove her own value
lillian achieves her goal to destroy rearden s business when she passes on information to james taggart about her husband s affair
this information is used to persuade rearden to sign the gift certificate which delivers all the property rights of rearden metal to the looters and thereby destroys his business
lillian discovers that she can accomplish her goal to destroy the business but she can neither achieve the greatness she desires nor her goal to destroy hank s character
she uses james taggart for sex as victory and revenge against hank and dagny
this does give her the satisfaction she desires and she continues to manipulate hank until he finally leaves her and joins galt s strikers
dr floyd ferris ferris is a biologist who works as co ordinator at the state science institute
he uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement and publishes a book entitled why do you think you think
he clashes on several occasions with hank rearden and twice attempts to blackmail rearden into giving up rearden metal
he is also one of the group of looters who tries to get rearden to agree to the steel unification plan
ferris hosts the demonstration of the project x weapon and is the creator of the ferris persuader a torture machine
when john galt is captured by the looters ferris uses the device on galt but it breaks down before extracting the information ferris wants from galt
ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters
dr robert stadlera former professor at patrick henry university mentor to francisco d anconia john galt and ragnar danneskjöld
he has since become a sell out one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval to the detriment of the free
he works at the state science institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military including the instrument of his demise project x xylophone
the character was in part modeled on j robert oppenheimer whom rand had interviewed for an earlier project and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons
to his former student galt stadler represents the epitome of human evil as the man who knew better but chose not to act for the good
he is based on plato
wesley mouchthe incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom hank rearden reluctantly employs in washington who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty
in return for betraying hank by helping broker the equalization of opportunity bill which by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one forces hank to divest most of his companies he is given a senior position at the bureau of economic planning and national resources
later in the novel he becomes its top co ordinator a position that eventually becomes economic dictator of the country

anthropology is the science of human ity
it has origins in the humanities the natural science s and the social science s the term is from the greek anthrōpos man understood to mean humankind or humanity and λογία discourse or study
since the work of franz boas and bronisław malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries anthropology has been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on in depth examination of context cross cultural comparisons and the importance it places on participant observation or long term experiential immersion in the area of research
cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques
this has been particularly prominent in the united states from boas s arguments against 19th century racial ideology through margaret mead s advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of post colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism
ethnography is one of its primary methods as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork
in the united states the discipline is traditionally divided into four sub fields cultural anthropology archaeology linguistic anthropology and biological anthropology
in europe the discipline originated as ethnology and was originally defined as the study of social organization in non state societies
it was later renamed social anthropology
it is now generally referred to as socio cultural anthropology in most of europe the commonwealth and in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition
disciplines in the united states anthropology is traditionally divided into four fields biological or physical anthropology social anthropology or cultural anthropology archaeology and anthropological linguistics
these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques
in great britain and the commonwealth countries the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate
in some european countries all cultural anthropology is known as ethnology a term coined and defined by adam f kollár in 1783
anthropologists study topics including the origin and evolution of homo sapiens the organization of human social and cultural relations human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and so forth
anthropology originated in the colonial encounter between western people and colonized non western people as europeans tried to understand the origins of observable cultural diversity
today anthropology is a global discipline and anthropologists study all types of societies
anthropology is one of the few places where humanities social and natural sciences are forced to confront one another
as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late 20th century interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies
according to clifford geertz anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact
long after natural history moral philosophy philology and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology human biology comparative linguistics and prehistory held together mainly by the vested interests sunk costs and administrative habits of academia and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship
sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies
during the 1970s and 1990s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline
during this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology
in contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist
due to this difference in epistemology the four sub fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades
sociocultural anthropology cultural anthropology is also called socio cultural anthropology or social anthropology especially in the united kingdom
cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups
cultural anthropology is more akin to philosophy literature and the arts while social anthropology to sociology and history
anthropological inquiry is guided by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values
accepting other cultures in their own terms prevents reductionism in cross cultural comparison
this project has become the field of ethnography
ethnography can refer to both a methodology and a product of research namely a monograph or book
as methodology ethnography is based upon long term fieldwork within a community or other research site
participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology
ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures
the process of participant observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic or insiders point of view
the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of cultural anthropology as kinship is a human universal
cultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization law and conflict resolution patterns of consumption and exchange material culture technology infrastructure gender relations ethnicity childrearing and socialization religion myth symbols values etiquette worldview sports music nutrition recreation games food festivals and language which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology
comparison across cultures is a key element of sociocultural anthropology s method including the industrialized or de industrialized west
cultures in the more traditional standard cross cultural sample of small scale societies are see also the list of indigenous peoples
biological anthropology biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non human primates in their biological evolutionary and demographic dimensions
it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates and that generate maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation
archaeological anthropology archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains
artifacts faunal remains and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies
archaeologists examine these material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices
ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups who are presumed to have lived in similar ways
linguistic anthropology linguistic anthropology also called anthropological linguistics seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and non verbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture
it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes
linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis
key topics by field socio cultural anthropology anthropology of art media music dance film anthropology of art one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon
several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in a significantly different form in most non western contexts
to surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities
boas primitive art claude lévi strauss the way of the masks 1982 or geertz s art as cultural system 1983 are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aesthetics
media anthropology anthropology of media also anthropology of mass media media anthropology emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media
the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production e g ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers journalists in the field film production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media
other types include cyber anthropology a relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education
this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s
musical anthropology ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music broadly defined that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire
visual anthropology visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid 1990s new media
while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media
visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphics paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology
economic political economic applied development anthropology economic anthropology economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope
it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical
its origins as a sub field of anthropology begin with the polish british founder of anthropology bronislaw malinowski and his french compatriot marcel mauss on the nature of gift giving exchange or reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange
economic anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange
the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production in contrast
economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective
political economy political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to non capitalist societies
political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture
three main areas of interest rapidly developed
the first of these areas was concerned with the pre capitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes
sahlins work on hunter gatherers as the original affluent society did much to disapate that image
the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world s population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam
the third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist world system
more recently these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial and post industrial capitalism around the world
applied anthropology applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems
it is a “ complex of related research based instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action and or the formulation of policy ”
more simply applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community
it is closely related to development anthropology distinct from the more critical anthropology of development
anthropology of development the anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective
the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach involve asking why if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing
why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes
why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer
why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis
in short why does so much planned development fail
anthropology of kinship feminism gender sexuality kinship family kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves
over its history anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship
broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent one s social relations during development and also relatives by marriage
feminist anthropology feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology archeological biological cultural linguistic that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge
anthropology engages often with feminists from non western traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white european and american feminists
historically such peripheral perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world
feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory
feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology as a specialization
anthropology of gender sexuality medical nutritional psychological cognitive transpersonal anthropology medical anthropology medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation
currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole
it focuses on the following six basic fields other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering farmer 1999 2003 beneduce 2010 as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness
on the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry
anthropology of food and nutrition nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter
if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization
nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development either in terms of human development or traditional western models for any given group of people
psychological anthropology psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes
this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural group — with its own history language practices and conceptual categories — shape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health
it also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes
cognitive anthropology cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms
cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them
transpersonal anthropology transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture
as with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness asc and transpersonal experience
however the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross cultural issues — for instance the roles of myth ritual diet and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences young and goulet 1994
political legal anthropology political anthropology political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies
political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies a new development started from the 1960s and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more “ complex ” social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena
the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels
first of all anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state regulated sphere as in patron client relations or tribal political organization
second of all anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions
an anthropology of the state developed and it is a most thriving field today
geertz ’ comparative work on negara the balinese state is an early famous example
legal anthropology legal anthropology also known as anthropology of law specializes in the cross cultural study of social ordering
earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation
more recent applications include issues such as human rights legal pluralism islamaphobia and political uprisings
public anthropology public anthropology was created by robert borofsky a professor at hawaii pacific university to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change borofsky 2004
anthropology of nature science technology cyborg anthropology cyborg anthropology originated as a sub focus group within the american anthropological association s annual meeting in 1993
the sub group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science
donna haraway ’s 1985 cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term
cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings
digital anthropology digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital era technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect
it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture
the field is new and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases
these include techno anthropology digital ethnography cyberanthropology and virtual anthropology
ecological anthropology ecological anthropology is defined as the “ study of cultural adaptation s to environments ”
the sub field is also defined as the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment
the focus of its research concerns “ how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems
” environmental anthropology environmental anthropology is a sub specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time
the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology and arguably at least the backdrop if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today is political ecology
many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues and more
the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for against or creation of policy and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land
often the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly organizing participation or indirectly articles documentaries books ethnographies
such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park
historical anthropology ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records
it is also the study of the history of various ethnic group s that may or may not exist today
ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation
its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts
practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps music paintings photography folklore oral tradition site exploration archaeological materials museum collections enduring customs language and place names
anthropology of religion the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across culture s modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion and that every religion is a cultural product created by the human community that worships it
urban anthropology urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism
ulf hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were a notoriously agoraphobic lot anti urban by definition
various social processes in the western world as well as in the third world the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes
there are two principle approaches in urban anthropology by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities
these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other
by defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities
by directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city
key topics by field archaeological biological anthropology anthrozoology anthrozoology also called human – animal studies or has is the study of interaction between living things
it is a modern interdisciplinary and burgeoning field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines including anthropology ethology medicine psychology veterinary medicine and zoology
a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions
it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields including anthropology sociology biology and philosophy
biocultural anthropology biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture
physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective that is from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences
after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology
evolutionary anthropology evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non hominin primate s evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science
evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans past and present
it is based on a scientific approach and brings together fields such as archaeology behavioral ecology psychology primatology and genetics
it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience past and present
forensic anthropology forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting most often in criminal cases where the victim s remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition
a forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed burned mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable
the adjective forensic refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law
palaeoanthropology paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints
anthropological organizations contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges
the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association aaa which was founded in 1903
membership is made up of anthropologists from around the globe
in 1989 a group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists easa which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe
the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology
hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub fields of anthropology sometimes divided up by nation or region and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines such as geology physics zoology paleontology anatomy music theory art history sociology and so on belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well
list of major organizations controversial ethical stances anthropologists like other researchers especially historians and scientists engaged in field research have over time assisted state policies and projects especially colonialism
some commentators have contended the ethics of cultural relativism at the same time anthropologists urge as part of their quest for scientific objectivity cultural relativism which has an influence on all the sub fields of anthropology
this is the notion that particular cultures should not be judged by one culture s values or viewpoints but that all cultures should be viewed as relative to each other
there should be no notions in good anthropology of one culture being better or worse than another culture
ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide infanticide racism mutilation including circumcision and subincision and torture
topics like racism slavery or human sacrifice therefore attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation have been proposed not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of man s inhumanity to man
to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach one can take just one of these topics such as racism and find thousands of anthropological references stretching across all the major and minor sub fields
ethical stance to military involvement anthropologists involvement with the u s government in particular has caused bitter controversy within the discipline
franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists
but by the 1940s many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan
many served in the armed forces while others worked in intelligence for example office of strategic services and the office of war information
at the same time david h price s work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies
attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up surprisingly little although anthropologist hugo nutini was active in the stillborn project camelot
many anthropologists students and teachers were active in the antiwar movement
numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association aaa
professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state
their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings
the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth asa has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous
the aaa s current statement of professional responsibility clearly states that in relation with their own government and with host governments no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given
anthropologists along with other social scientists are working with the us military as part of the us army s strategy in afghanistan
the christian science monitor reports that counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs in afghanistan under the human terrain system hts program in addition hts teams are working with the us military in iraq
in 2009 the american anthropological association s commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding in part that when ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions not subject to external review where data collection occurs in the context of war integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology
in summary while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of “ anthropology ” within dod
post – world war ii developments before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions
after the war enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology
basic trends there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work
one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical
the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place problem or phenomenon in detail using a variety of methods over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia
in the 1990s and 2000s decade calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard
it is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large ever changing global culture
these dynamic relationships between what can be observed on the ground as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic or archaeological
biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals behaviors ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures they use many different methods of study but modern population genetics participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field which means traveling to a community in its own setting to do something called fieldwork
on the biological or physical side human measurements genetic samples nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs
along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions
human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material such as the paleolithic and the neolithic of particular use in archaeology
further cultural subdivisions according to tool types such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past
anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well since mapping cultures is central to both sciences
by making comparisons across cultural traditions time based and cultural regions space based anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method a central part of their science
commonalities between fields because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises see history of anthropology including but not limited to fossil hunting exploring documentary film making paleontology primatology antiquity dealings and curatorship philology etymology genetics regional analysis ethnology history philosophy and religious studies it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made
some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of other cultures both in terms of time past societies and space non european non western societies
for example the classic of urban anthropology ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the third world had habitually received most of attention anthropologists who traditionally specialized in other cultures looked for them far away and started to look across the tracks only in late 1960s
now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author s home
it is also argued that other fields of study like history and sociology on the contrary focus disproportionately on the west
in france the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologist s but this is increasingly changing starting in the 1970s from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain fieldwork and developing with the center founded by marc augé le centre d anthropologie des mondes contemporains the anthropological research center of contemporary societies
since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale
there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people increasingly research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories social movements governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses

agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact natural economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture
veterinary science but not animal science is often excluded from the definition
agriculture and agricultural science the two terms are often confused
however they cover different concepts agricultural sciences include research and development on fertilizer one of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter
yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue which can take a few months to several years to decompose depending on the crop s c to n ratio and the local environment agricultural science a local science with the exception of theoretical agronomy research in agronomy more than in any other field is strongly related to local areas
it can be considered a science of ecoregions because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate which are never exactly the same from one place to another
many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather soil characteristics and specific crops has to be studied locally
others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible and the human dimension of interaction with nature
history of agricultural science agricultural science began with tara s genetic work but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in eighteenth century germany
in the united states a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the hatch act of 1887 which used the term agricultural science
the hatch act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer
the ammy of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots but the scientific foundation had been built
after 1906 public expenditures on agricultural research in the us exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years
intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and developing countries often referred to as the green revolution was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizer s and phytosanitary product s as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture industrial development and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields
these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology such as integrated pest management waste treatment technologies landscape architecture genomics and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non essential economic goods
in fact the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science
new technologies such as biotechnology and computer science for data processing and storage and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields including genetic engineering agrophysics improved statistical analysis and precision farming
balancing these as above are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human nature interactions of traditional agriculture including interaction of religion and agriculture and the non material components of agricultural production systems
prominent agricultural scientists agricultural science and agriculture crisis agriculture sciences seek to feed the world s population while preventing biosafety problems that may affect human health and the environment
this requires promoting good management of natural resources and respect for the environment and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system
economic environmental and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate
recent crises such as avian influenza mad cow disease and issues such as the use of genetically modified organism s illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate

alchemy is an influential philosophical tradition whose early practitioners claims to profound powers were known from antiquity
the defining objectives of alchemy are varied these include the creation of the fabled philosopher s stone possessing powers including the capability of turning base metal s into the noble metals gold or silver as well as an elixir of life conferring youth and longevity
western alchemy is recognized as a protoscience that contributed to the development of modern chemistry and medicine
alchemists developed a framework of theory terminology experimental process and basic laboratory techniques that are still recognizable today
but alchemy differs from modern science in the inclusion of hermetic principles and practices related to mythology religion and spirituality
overview the defining goals of alchemy are often given as the of common metals into gold known as chrysopoeia the creation of a panacea and the discovery of a universal solvent
however this only highlights certain aspects of alchemy
alchemist s have historically rewritten and evolved the explanation of their art making a singular definition difficult
h j sheppard gives the following as a comprehensive summary modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric aspects
the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who have examined the subject in terms of proto chemistry medicine and charlatanism
the latter is of interest to the historians of esotericism psychologists spiritual and new age communities and hermetic philosophers
the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts
despite the modern split numerous sources stress an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy
holmyard when writing on exoteric aspects states that they can not be properly appreciated if the esoteric is not always kept in mind
the prototype for this model can be found in bolos of mendes third century bce work physika kai mystika on physical and mystical matters
marie louise von franz tells us the double approach of western alchemy was set from the start when greek philosophy was mixed with egyptian and mesopotamian technology
the technological operative approach which she calls extravert ed and the mystic contemplative psychological one which she calls introvert ed are not mutually exclusive but complementary instead as meditation requires practice in the real world and conversely
relation to the science of chemistry practical applications of alchemy produced a wide range of contributions to medicine and the physical sciences
the alchemist robert boyle is credited as being the father of chemistry
paracelsian iatrochemistry emphasized the medicinal application of alchemy continued in plant alchemy or spagyric
studies of alchemy also influenced isaac newton s theory of gravity
academic historical research supports that the alchemists were searching for a material substance using physical methods
it is a popular belief that alchemists made contributions to the chemical industries of the day — ore testing and refining metalworking production of gunpowder ink dyes paints cosmetics leather tanning ceramics glass manufacture preparation of extracts liquors and so on it seems that the preparation of aqua vitae the water of life was a fairly popular experiment among european alchemists
alchemists contributed distillation to western europe
the attempts of alchemists to arrange information on substances so as to clarify and anticipate the products of their chemical reactions resulted in early conceptions of chemical elements and the first rudimentary periodic table s they learned how to extract metals from ores and how to compose many types of inorganic acids and bases
during the 17th century practical alchemy started to disappear in favor of its younger offshoot chemistry as it was renamed by robert boyle the father of modern chemistry
in his book the skeptical chymist boyle attacked paracelsus and the natural philosophy of aristotle which was taught at universities
however boyle s biographers in their emphasis that he laid the foundations of modern chemistry neglect how steadily he clung to the scholastic sciences and to alchemy in theory practice and doctrine
the decline of alchemy continued in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry which provided a more precise and reliable framework within a new view of the universe based on rational materialism
relation to hermeticism in the eyes of a variety of esoteric and hermetic practitioners the heart of alchemy is spiritual
transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation purification and perfection
this approach is often termed spiritual esoteric or internal alchemy
early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis c ad 300 highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul
this approach continued in the middle ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes were used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation
in this sense the literal meanings of alchemical formulas were a blind hiding their true spiritual philosophy
practitioners and patrons such as melchior cibinensis and pope innocent viii existed within the ranks of the church while martin luther applauded alchemy for its consistency with christian teachings
both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state towards a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state and the philosopher s stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible
applied to the alchemist himself the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal
in texts that are written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbol s diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning
in his 1766 alchemical catechism théodore henri de tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was a symbol during the renaissance alchemy broke into more distinct schools placing spiritual alchemists in high contrast with those working with literal metals and chemicals
while most spiritual alchemists also incorporate elements of exotericism examples of a purely spiritual alchemy can be traced back as far as the sixteenth century when jacob boehme used alchemical terminology in strictly mystical writings
another example can be found in the work of heinrich khunrath 1560 – 1605 who viewed the process of transmutation as occurring within the alchemist s soul
the recent work of l m principe and william r newman seeks to reject the spiritual interpretation of alchemy especially as applied to medieval 16th and 17th century alchemy stating it arose as a product of the victorian occult revival
there is evidence to support that some classical alchemical sources were adulterated during this time to give greater weight to the spiritual aspects of alchemy
despite this other scholars such as calian and tilton reject this view as entirely historically inaccurate drawing examples of historical spiritual alchemy from boehme isaac newton and michael maier
etymology the word alchemy may derive from the old french alquimie which is from the medieval latin alchimia and which is in turn from the arabic al kimia
this term itself is derived from the ancient greek chemeia χημεία or chemia χημία with the addition of the arabic definite article al
the ancient greek word may have been derived from a version of the egyptian name for egypt which was itself based on the ancient egyptian word kēme hieroglyphic khmi black earth as opposed to desert sand
the word could also have originally derived from the greek chumeia χυμεία meaning mixture and referring to pharmaceutical chemistry
with the later rise of alchemy in alexandria the word may have derived from χημία and thus became spelled as χημεία and the original meaning forgotten
its etymology is still open to question
history alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents
these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships
one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be largely independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china and its zone of cultural influence indian alchemy centered around the indian subcontinent and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from greco roman egypt to the islamic world and finally medieval europe
chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths whereas western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of but influenced by various western religion s it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other
alchemy in greco roman egypt the origin of western alchemy may generally be traced to hellenistic egypt
the hellenistic city of alexandria was a center of greek alchemical knowledge and retained its preeminence through most of the greek and roman periods
here elements of technology religion mythology and greek philosophy each with their own much longer histories combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the west
zosimos of panopolis wrote the oldest known books on alchemy while mary the jewess is credited as being the first non fictitious western alchemist
they wrote in greek and lived in egypt under roman rule
mythology – it is claimed by zosimos of panopolis that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class there is little or no evidence for such a claim though
alchemical writers used classical figures from greek roman and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation
these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets isis osiris jason and many others
the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus or thrice great hermes
his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes
hermes and his caduceus or serpent staff were among alchemy s principal symbols
according to clement of alexandria he wrote what were called the forty two books of hermes covering all fields of knowledge
the hermetica of thrice great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners
these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era
technology – the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to 3500 bce
many writings were lost when the emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria 292 ce
few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus x
dating from 300 to 500 ce they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and the manufacture of imitation gold and silver
these writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of bolus of mendes or pseudo democritus which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements
between the time of bolus and zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a hermetic art
philosophy – alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism platonism stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy s character
an important example of alchemy s roots in greek philosophy originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire
according to aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed
the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are
true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present day sense of the word
the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form
later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept
alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity
lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth
augustine 354 – 430 ce later affirmed this but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry
examples of pagan christian and jewish alchemists can be found during this period
most of the greco roman alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms such as moses isis cleopatra democritus and ostanes
others authors such as komarios and chymes we only know through fragments of text
after 400 ce greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors
by the middle of the seventh century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline
it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries
alchemy in the islamic world after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world
much more is known about islam ic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations
the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word الكيمياء al kimia
the islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy
plato nic and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries
in the late 8th century jābir ibn hayyān known as geber in europe introduced a new approach to alchemy based on scientific method ology and controlled experiment ation in the laboratory in contrast to the ancient greek and egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible with very little concern for laboratory work
jabir is thus considered by many to be the father of chemistry albeit others reserve that title for robert boyle or antoine lavoisier
the historian of science paul kraus wrote jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation as follows early islamic chemists such as jabir ibn hayyan جابر بن حيان in arabic geberus in latin usually rendered in english as geber al kindi alkindus and muhammad ibn zakarīya rāzi rasis or rhazes in latin contributed a number of key chemical discoveries such as the muriatic hydrochloric acid sulfuric and nitric acid s and more
the discovery that aqua regia a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids could dissolve the noblest metal gold was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium
islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism
the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir
jabir s ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life
he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness
according to jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior
for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist
thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result
by this reasoning the search for the philosopher s stone was introduced to western alchemy
jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance s name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the element s physical properties
the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir
his original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical element s aether air earth fire and water in addition to two chemical element s representing the metal s sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties
shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidity
the atomic theory of corpuscularianism where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of jabir
during the 9th to 14th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists including alkindus abū al rayhān al bīrūnī avicenna and ibn khaldun
in particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals
alchemy in medieval europe the introduction of alchemy to latin europe occurred on february 11 1144 with the completion of robert of chester s translation of the arabic book of the composition of alchemy
although european craftsmen and technicians preexisted robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing
the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in twelfth century toledo spain through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath
translations of the time included the turba philosophorum and the works of avicenna and al razi
these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent
alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples
meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought
saint anselm 1033 – 1109 put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context
peter abelard followed anselm s work laying the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle reached the west
later robert grosseteste 1170 – 1253 took abelard s methods of analysis and added the use of observations experimentation and conclusions in making scientific evaluations
grosseteste also did much work to bridge platonic and aristotelian thinking
through much of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered around translations and new latin contributions were not made
the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists
albertus magnus and roger bacon are the most notable of these
their works explained and summarized the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms
there is little to suggest that albertus magnus 1193 – 1280 a dominican was himself an alchemist
in his authentic works such as the book of minerals he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time
albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals
from the time shortly after his death through to the fifteenth century twenty eight or more alchemical tracts were misattributed to him a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist
likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to albert s student thomas aquinas 1225 – 1274
roger bacon 1214 – 1294 was an oxford franciscan who studied a wide variety of topics including optics languages and medicine
after studying the pseudo aristotelian secretum secretorum around 1247 he dramatically shifted his studies towards a vision of a universal science which included alchemy and astrology
bacon maintained that albertus magnus ignorance of the fundamentals of alchemy prevented a complete picture of wisdom
while alchemy was not more important to him than any of the other sciences and he did not produce symbolic allegorical works bacon s contributions advanced alchemy s connections to soteriology and christian theology
bacon s writings demonstrated an integration of morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life
his correspondence with pope clement iv highlighted this integration calling attention to the importance of alchemy to the papacy
like the greeks before him bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into the practical and theoretical
he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle the natural philosophers and all latin writers of his time
the practical however confirmed the theoretical through experiment and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine
soon after bacon the influential work of pseudo geber sometimes identified as paul of taranto appeared
his summa perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods
it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur mercury theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described
by the end of the 13th century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief
adepts believed in the macrocosm microcosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body for example if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul
they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated
finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observation s and theories about how the universe operated
their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man s soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam
by purifying the two parts of man s soul man could be reunited with god
in the 14th century alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars
alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves
dante piers the ploughman and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars
pope john xxii s 1317 edict spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo alchemists
in 1403 henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically and a number were granted by henry vi and edward iv
these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly christian tone
the 14th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus john of rupescissa and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova
nicolas flamel is a well known alchemist but a good example of pseudepigraphy the practice of giving your works the name of someone else usually more famous
though the historical flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612
flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher s stone
his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations
most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosopher s stone
through the late middle ages 1300 – 1500 alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone
bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions in the 14th and 15th centuries
their cryptic allusions and symbol ism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art
alchemy in the renaissance and modern age during the renaissance hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy
the dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed
in the late fifteenth century marsilo ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin
these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent
renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel
esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and christian cabala
a key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa 1486 – 1535 who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists
in his de occulta philosophia he attempted to merge kabbalah hermetism and alchemy
he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy
philippus aureolus paracelsus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim 1493 – 1541 cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some of agrippa ’s occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia
paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver
for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines
his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm
he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soul purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them
paracelsian practical alchemy especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named spagyrics a synonym for alchemy from the greek words meaning to separate and to join together based on the latin alchemic maxim solve et coagula
iatrochemistry also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus
john dee 13 july 1527 – december 1608 followed agrippa ’s occult tradition
though better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to queen elizabeth i dee ’s alchemical monas hieroglyphica written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work
his writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below
entrepreneurial opportunities were not uncommon for the alchemists of renaissance europe
alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones
rudolf ii holy roman emperor in the late 16th century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague including dee and his associate edward kelley
king james iv of scotland julius duke of brunswick lüneburg henry v duke of brunswick lüneburg augustus elector of saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn and maurice landgrave of hesse kassel all contracted alchemists
john ’s son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus
though most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of pseudo alchemical fraud continued through the renaissance
betrüger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage
legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artist s false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud
the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and small scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day
there were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic
for example tycho brahe 1546 – 1601 an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had a laboratory built at his uraniborg observatory research institute
michael sendivogius michał sędziwój 1566 – 1636 a polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600
sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who in 1621 applied this in a submarine
isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy see isaac newton s occult studies than he did to either optics or physics
other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle and jan baptist van helmont
their hermetism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science
the decline of western alchemy the demise of western alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom
although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its apogee in the 18th century
as late as 1781 james price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold
robert boyle 1627 – 1691 better known for his studies of gases cf boyle s law pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations
he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data in a typical experiment boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant
this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries of lavoisier and john dalton — which finally provided a logical quantitative and reliable framework for understanding matter transmutations and revealed the futility of longstanding alchemical goals such as the philosopher s stone
meanwhile paracelsian alchemy led to the development of modern medicine
experimentalists gradually uncovered the workings of the human body such as blood circulation harvey 1616 and eventually traced many diseases to infections with germs koch and pasteur 19th century or lack of natural nutrients and vitamin s lind eijkman funk et al
supported by parallel developments in organic chemistry the new science easily displaced alchemy from its medical roles interpretive and prescriptive while deflating its hopes of miraculous elixirs and exposing the ineffectiveness or even toxicity of its remedies
during the seventeenth century a short lived supernatural interpretation of alchemy become popular including support by fellows of the royal society robert boyle and elias ashmole
proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher s stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels
the words alchemy and chemistry were used interchangeably during most of the seventeenth century only during the eighteenth century was a distinction drawn rigidly between the two
in the eighteenth century alchemy was considered to be restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that most if not all alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud
the obscure and secretive writings of the alchemists was used as a case by those who wished to forward a fraudulent and non scientific opinion of alchemy
in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the scientific enlightenment attempted for the sake of survival to separate and divorce the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy
this move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and even to the present day
during the occult revival of the early nineteenth century alchemy received new attention as an occult science
the esoteric or occultist school which arose during the nineteenth century held and continues to hold the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience
this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes
in the nineteenth century revival of alchemy the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy
both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy as atwood claimed no modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with alchemy
atwood s work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite and rudolf steiner
hitchcock in his remarks upon alchymists 1855 attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state
in 1845 baron carl reichenbach published his studies on odic force a concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion
indian alchemy according to multhauf gilbert 2008 the oldest indian writings the vedas hindu sacred scriptures contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient china namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life
mercury which was so vital to alchemy everywhere is first mentioned in the 4th to 3rd century bc artha śāstra about the same time it is encountered in china and in the west
evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd to 5th century ad buddhist texts about the same time as in the west
since alexander the great had invaded ancient india in 325 bc leaving a greek state gandhāra that long endured the possibility exists that the indians acquired the idea from the greeks but it could have been the other way around
significant progress in alchemy was made in ancient india
will durant wrote in our oriental heritage an 11th century persian chemist and physician named abū rayhān bīrūnī reported that they have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them which in sanskrit is called rasayāna and in persian rasavātam
it means the art of obtaining manipulating rasa nectar mercury and juice
this art was restricted to certain operations metals drugs compounds and medicines many of which have mercury as their core element
its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age
one thing is sure though indian alchemy like every other indian science is focused on finding moksha perfection immortality liberation
as such it focuses its efforts on transmutation of the human body from mortal to immortal
many are the traditional stories of alchemists still alive since time immemorial due to the effects of their experiments
since alchemy eventually became ingrained in the vast field of indian erudition influences from other metaphysical and philosophical doctrines such as samkhya yoga vaisheshika and ayurveda were inevitable
nonetheless most of the rasayāna texts track their origins back to kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath
two famous early indian alchemical authors were nāgārjuna siddha and nityanātha siddha
nāgārjuna siddha was a buddhist or jaina monk
his book rasendramangalam is an example of indian alchemy and medicine
nityanātha siddha wrote rasaratnākara also a highly influential work
in sanskrit rasa translates as mercury and nāgārjuna siddha was said to have developed a method or converting mercury into gold
reliable scholarship on indian alchemy has been advanced in a major way by the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white
trustworthy scholarship on indian alchemy must now take the findings of this work into account
an important modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has also been provided by david gordon white at oxford bibliographies online
chinese alchemy whereas western alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine
the philosopher s stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists
however in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosopher s stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears
black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists
described in 9th century texts and used in fireworks in china by the 10th century it was used in cannon s by 1290
from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongol s the arab world and europe
gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in 1241 and in europe by the 14th century
chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion and to martial arts such as tai chi chuan and kung fu although some tai chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of taoism not alchemical
in fact in the early song dynasty followers of this taoist idea chiefly the elite and upper class would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide
thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources the aforementioned tai chi chuan mastering of the qi etc
alchemy as a subject of historical research the history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study
as the language of the alchemists is analyzed historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements
institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university the university of exeter centre for the study of esotericism exeseso the european society for the study of western esotericism esswe and the university of amsterdam s sub department for the history of hermetic philosophy and related currents
a large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the bibliotheca philosophica hermetica in amsterdam
journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ambix published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry and isis published by the history of science society
modern alchemy due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the eighteenth century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry the general understanding of alchemy in the general public modern practitioners and also many historians of science have been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations
hundreds of books including adulterated translations of classical alchemical literature were published throughout the early nineteenth century
many of these continue to be reprinted today by esoteric book publishing houses along with modern books on spiritual alchemy and poor translations of older alchemical texts
these are then used as sources by modern authors to support spiritual interpretations
over half of the books on alchemy published since 1970 support spiritual interpretations mostly using previously adulterated documents to support their conclusions
many of these books continue to be taken seriously even appearing in university bookshelves
esoteric interpretations of alchemy remain strong to this day and continue to influence both the public and academic perceptions of the history of alchemy
today numerous esoteric alchemical groups continue to perpetuate modern interpretations of alchemy sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements
rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism
alchemy in traditional medicine traditional medicine sometimes involves the transmutation of natural substances using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques
in ayurveda the samskaras are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity
these processes are actively used to the present day
twentieth century spagyrists albert richard riedel and jean dubuis merged paracelsian alchemy with occultism teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods
the schools they founded les philosophes de la nature and the paracelsus research society popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products
the courses books organizations and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a new age medicinal practice
psychology alchemical symbolism has been used by psychologists such as carl jung who reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and presented the inner meaning of alchemical work as a spiritual path
jung was deeply interested in the occult since his youth participating in seances which he used as the basis for his doctoral dissertation on the psychology and pathology of so called occult phenomena
in 1913 jung had already adopted a spiritualist and redemptive interpretation of alchemy likely reflecting his interest in the occult literature of the nineteenth century
jung began writing his views on alchemy from the 1920s and continued until the end of his life
his interpretation of chinese alchemical texts in terms of his analytical psychology also served the function of comparing eastern and western alchemical imagery and core concepts and hence its possible inner sources archetypes
jung saw alchemy as a western proto psychology dedicated to the achievement of individuation
in his interpretation alchemy was the vessel by which gnosticism survived its various purges into the renaissance a concept also followed by others such as stephan a hoeller
in this sense jung viewed alchemy as comparable to a yoga of the east and more adequate to the western mind than eastern religions and philosophies
the practice of alchemy seemed to change the mind and spirit of the alchemist
conversely spontaneous changes on the mind of western people undergoing any important stage in individuation seems to produce on occasion imagery known to alchemy and relevant to the person s situation
jung did not completely reject the material experiments of the alchemists but he massively downplayed it writing that the transmutation was performed in the mind of the alchemist
he claimed the material substances and procedures were only a projection of the alchemists internal state while the real substance to be transformed was the mind itself
marie louise von franz a disciple of jung continued jung s studies on alchemy and its psychological meaning
jung s work exercised a great influence on the mainstream perception of alchemy his approach becoming a stock element in many popular texts on the subject to this day
modern scholars are sometimes critical of the jungian approach to alchemy as overly reflective of nineteenth century occultism
magnum opus the great work of alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors
alchemy in art and entertainment alchemy has had a long standing relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment
literary alchemy appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to j k rowling
here characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus
in the fourteenth century chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of terry pratchett
visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy
while some of them used alchemy as a source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work
music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers
in the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television comics and video games

an astronomer is a scientist who studies celestial bodies such as moons planets stars nebulae and galaxies the physics chemistry and evolution of such objects and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of earth such as supernovae explosions gamma ray bursts and cosmic background radiation
a related but distinct subject cosmology is concerned with studying the universe as a whole
historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws
today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable
professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities
they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory
the number of professional astronomers in the united states is actually quite small
the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately 7 700 members
this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy
the international astronomical union comprises almost 10 145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond
while the number of professional astronomers worldwide is not much larger than the population of a small town there is a huge community of amateur astronomers
most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties in their communities
the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations
like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research
however amateurs span the range from so called armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own science grade telescope s and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research
modern astronomers contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night it is very rare for a modern professional astronomer to use an eyepiece on a larger telescope
it is far more common to use a charge coupled device camera to record a long deep exposure allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time
before ccds photographic plates were a common method of observation
modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes most spend a few weeks per year observing and the rest of their time reducing the data changing it from raw data to processed images and analyzing it
many astronomers work entirely from astronomical survey or space observatory data
others work with radio telescopes like the very large array which is entirely automated although it is maintained by telescope operators
some astronomers do not work with data at all but instead use computational simulations or analytical models to provide analysis of observed phenomena or make predictions for observational astronomers
astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes
most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetarium s as a public service to encourage interest in the field

amoeboids are single celled life forms characterized by an irregular shape
amoeboid and amœba are often used interchangeably even by biologists and especially refer to a creature moving by using pseudopod ia
most references to amoebas or amoebae are to amoeboids in general rather than to the specific genus amoeba
the genus amoeba and amoeboids in general both derive their names from the ancient greek word for change
structure amoeboids move using pseudopodia which are bulges of cytoplasm
amoebas breathe using their entire cell membrane that is constantly immersed in water
excess water can cross into the cytosol
amoebas have a contractile vacuole to expel excess water
food sources vary in amoeboids
they may consume bacteria or other protist s some are detritivore s and eat dead organic material
they extend a pair of pseudopodia around food
they fuse to make a food vacuole which then fuses with a lysosome to add digestive chemicals
undigested food is expelled at the cell membrane
amoebas use pseudopodia to move and feed
they are powered by flexibe microfilament s near the membrane
microfilaments are at least 50 of the cytoskeleton
the other parts are more stiff and are composed of intermediate filament s and microtubule s these are not used in amoeboid movement but are stiff skeletons on which organelles are supported or can move on
the shells of amoebas are often composed of calcium
the proteins or materials are synthesised in the cell and exported just outside the cell membrane
multicellular amoebas slime molds amoebas seem to have connections with two phyla now defunct composed of multicellular organism s of the lineage of fungus like protists the so called slime mold s these two defunct phyla were the myxomycota i e plasmodial slime molds now classified in the taxon myxogastria and acrasiomycota i e cellular slime molds now divided into the taxa acrasida and dictyosteliida
these two phyla use amoeboid movement in their feeding stage
the former is basically a giant multinucleate amoeba while the latter lives solitary until food runs out in which a colony of these functions as a unit
myxomycete slime molds use amoeboid gametes as well
diversity they have appeared in a number of different groups
some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid for instance human white blood cell s which consume pathogens
many protist s also exist as individual amoeboid cells or take such a form at some point in their life cycle
the most famous such organism is amoeba proteus the name amoeba is variously used to describe its close relatives other organisms similar to it or the amoeboids in general
classification as amoebas themselves are polyphyletic and subject to some imprecision in definition the term amoeboid does not provide identification of an organism and is better understood as description of locomotion
when used in the broader sense the term can include many different groups
one source includes 97 different genera
others include far fewer
older classification in older classification systems amoeboids under the taxon name sarcodina had been divided into several morphological categories based on the form and structure of their pseudopod s amoeboids with pseudopods supported by regular arrays of microtubule s were called actinopods whereas those that were n t were called rhizopods which were further subdivided into lobose filose and reticulose amoebae
in contrast to rhizopods where most of their morphologies can be mapped to modern classification systems actinopods appear to be extensively polyphyletic
actinopods are divided into radiolaria and heliozoa itself a polyphyletic grouping
finally there was also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids the xenophyophore s that did not fall into any of these categories
modern classification more modern classifications are based upon cladistics
it has been stated that most amoeboid are now grouped in amoebozoa or rhizaria
however in contexts where amoeboid is defined more loosely there are many amoeboid species that are in the excavata clade
phylogenetic analyses place these genera into the following groups not all of these are considered amoeboid or amoebas by all sources pathogenic interactions with other organisms some amoeboids can infect other organisms pathogen ically causing disease references external links
the american standard code for information interchange ascii is a character encoding scheme originally based on the english alphabet
ascii codes represent text in computer s communications equipment and other devices that use text
most modern character encoding schemes are based on ascii though they support many additional characters
ascii developed from telegraphic codes
its first commercial use was as a seven bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services
work on the ascii standard began on october 6 1960 with the first meeting of the american standards association s asa x3 2 subcommittee
the first edition of the standard was published during 1963 a major revision during 1967 and the most recent update during 1986
compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting i e alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters
ascii includes definitions for 128 characters 33 are non printing control character s many now obsolete that affect how text and space are processed and 95 printable characters including the space which is considered an invisible graphic
the iana prefers the name us ascii to avoid ambiguity
ascii was the most commonly used character encoding on the world wide web until december 2007 when it was surpassed by utf 8
history the american standard code for information interchange ascii was developed under the auspices of a committee of the american standards association called the x3 committee by its x3 2 later x3l2 subcommittee and later by that subcommittee s x3 2 4 working group
the asa became the united states of america standards institute or usasi and ultimately the american national standards institute
the x3 2 subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems
like other character encoding s ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols i e grapheme s and control character s
this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate character oriented information such as written language
before ascii was developed the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters 10 numerical digit s and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols
to include all these and control characters compatible with the comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ccitt international telegraph alphabet no 2 ita2 standard fieldata and early ebcdic more than 64 codes were required for ascii
the committee debated the possibility of a shift key function like the baudot code which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by six bit s in a shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes
it allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable
the standards committee decided against shifting and so ascii required at least a seven bit code
the committee considered an eight bit code since eight bits octet s would allow two four bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary coded decimal
however it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice
the committee voted to use a seven bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission
since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired
eight bit machines with octets as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0
the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification
the first two columns 32 positions were reserved for control characters
the space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position 20 hex for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits
the committee decided it was important to support upper case 64 character alphabets and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64 character set of graphic codes
lower case letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case
to keep options available for lower case letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter a was placed in position 41 hex to match the draft of the corresponding british standard
the digits 0 – 9 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 011 making conversion with binary coded decimal straightforward
many of the non alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters
thus and were placed to correspond to 3 4 and 5 in the adjacent column
the parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0 however because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character
since many european typewriters placed the parentheses with 8 and 9 those corresponding positions were chosen for the parentheses
the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented à in the french variation so the was placed in position 40 hex next to the letter a the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message som end of address eoa end of message eom end of transmission eot who are you
wru are you
ru a reserved device control dc0 synchronous idle sync and acknowledge ack
these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns
with the other special characters and control codes filled in ascii was published as asa x3 4 1963 leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code
there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lower case alphabet
the indecision did not last long during may 1963 the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lower case characters to columns 6 and 7 and international organization for standardization tc 97 sc 2 voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard
the x3 2 4 task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may 1963 meeting
locating the lowercase letters in columns 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit which simplified case insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers
the x3 committee made other changes including other new characters the brace and vertical line characters renaming some control characters som became start of header soh and moving or removing others ru was removed
ascii was subsequently updated as usasi x3 4 1967 then usasi x3 4 1968 ansi x3 4 1977 and finally ansi x3 4 1986 the first two are occasionally retronamed ansi x3 4 1967 and ansi x3 4 1968
the x3 committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted least significant bit first and how it should be recorded on perforated tape
they proposed a 9 track standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some forms of punched card formats
ascii itself was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven bit teleprinter code for american telephone telegraph s twx teletypewriter exchange network
twx originally used the earlier five bit baudot code which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system
bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence
his british colleague hugh mcgregor ross helped to popularize this work — according to bemer so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the bemer ross code in europe
because of his extensive work on ascii bemer has been called the father of ascii
on march 11 1968 u s president lyndon b johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii stating i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations
all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july 1 1969 must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used
other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso iec 646 that are identical or nearly identical to ascii with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states such as the symbol for the united kingdom s pound sterling £
almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii since ascii suited the needs of only the usa and a few other countries
for example canada had its own version that supported french characters
other adapted encodings include iscii india viscii vietnam and yuscii yugoslavia
although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii true ascii is defined strictly only by ansi standard
ascii was incorporated into the unicode character set as the first 128 symbols so the ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets
this allows utf 8 to be backward compatible with ascii a significant advantage
ascii control characters ascii reserves the first 32 codes numbers 0 – 31 decimal for control character s codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices such as printer s that make use of ascii or to provide meta information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape
for example character 10 represents the line feed function which causes a printer to advance its paper and character 8 represents backspace
rfc 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as non whitespace control characters
except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line oriented formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document
other schemes such as markup language s address page and document layout and formatting
the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character
the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental such as what delete means
probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model 33 asr which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader punch option
paper tape was a very popular medium for long term program storage until the 1980s less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape
in particular the teletype model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 control q dc1 also known as xon 19 control s dc3 also known as xoff and 127 delete became de facto standards
because the keytop for the o key also showed a left arrow symbol from ascii 1963 which had this character instead of underscore a noncompliant use of code 15 control o shift in interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected
the use of control s xoff an abbreviation for transmit off as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow and control q xon transmit on to resume sending persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique
on some systems control s retains its meaning but control q is replaced by a second control s to resume output
code 127 is officially named delete but the teletype label was rubout
since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes interpretations of this code varied
the original teletype meaning and the intent of the standard was to make it an ignored character the same as nul all zeroes
this was useful specifically for paper tape because punching the all ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it
tapes designed to be hand edited could even be produced with spaces of extra nuls blank tape so that a block of characters could be rubbed out and then replacements put into the empty space
as video terminals began to replace printing ones the value of the rubout character was lost
dec systems for example interpreted delete to mean remove the character before the cursor and this interpretation also became common in unix systems
most other systems used backspace for that meaning and used delete to mean remove the character at the cursor
that latter interpretation is the most common now
many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones
the escape character esc code 27 for example was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning
this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings c language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning
over time this meaning has been co opted and has eventually been changed
in modern use an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so called ansi escape code or more properly a control sequence introducer beginning with esc followed by a left bracket character
an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an out of band character used to terminate an operation as in the teco and vi text editor s in graphical user interface gui and windowing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit terminate altogether
the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems
the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating system s teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both carriage return which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line and line feed which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead
the name carriage return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the keys struck the ribbon remained stationary
the entire carriage had to be pushed returned to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line
dec operating systems os 8 rt 11 rsx 11 rsts tops 10 etc used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device originally teletype machines would work
by the time so called glass ttys later called crts or terminals came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention
when gary kildall cloned rt 11 to create cp m he followed established dec convention
until the introduction of pc dos in 1981 ibm had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless
ibm s pc dos also marketed as ms dos by microsoft inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of cp m and windows inherited it from ms dos
unfortunately requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone
to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed lf alone as a line terminator
unix and unix like systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics
the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos on the other hand used carriage return cr alone as a line terminator however since apple replaced it with the unix based os x operating system they now use line feed lf as well
computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops 10 and tenex using cr lf line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as os 360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used ebcdic rather than ascii
the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal nvt so that connections between hosts with different line ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network it used ascii along with cr lf line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt
the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode
this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for e mail and the world wide web on systems not using the nvt s cr lf line ending convention
older operating systems such as tops 10 along with cp m tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control z sub to mark the end of the actual text in the file
for this reason eof or end of file was used colloquially and conventionally as a three letter acronym tla for control z instead of substitute
for a variety of reasons the end of text code etx aka control c was inappropriate and using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet a very convenient mnemonic aid
an historic common and still prevalent convention uses the etx aka control c code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboard
in c library and unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text string s such null terminated string s can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where here z stands for zero
ascii control code chart ascii printable characters codes 20 hex to 7e hex known as the printable characters represent letters digits punctuation marks and a few miscellaneous symbols
there are 95 printable characters in total
code 20 hex the space character denotes the space between words as produced by the space bar of a keyboard
since the space character is considered an invisible graphic rather than a control character and thus would not normally be visible it is represented here by unicode character u 2420 ␠ unicode characters u 2422 ␢ and u 2423 ␣ are also available for use when a visible representation of a space is necessary
code 7f hex corresponds to the non printable delete del control character and is therefore omitted from this chart it is covered in the previous section s chart
earlier versions of ascii used the up arrow instead of the caret 5e hex and the left arrow instead of the underscore 5f hex
aliases a june 1992 rfc and the internet assigned numbers authority registry of character sets recognize the following case insensitive aliases for ascii as suitable for use on the internet of these the iana encourages use of the name us ascii for internet uses of ascii
one often finds this in the optional charset parameter in the content type header of some mime messages in the equivalent meta element of some html documents and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some xml documents
variants as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of non english languages that used roman based alphabets
one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve ascii s character map in the 7 bit range
the petscii code commodore international used for their 8 bit systems is probably unique among post 1970 codes in being based on ascii 1963 instead of the more common ascii 1967 such as found on the zx spectrum computer
atari and galaksija computers also used ascii variants
7 bit from early in its development ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard ultimately published as iso iec 646 1972 which would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code point s reserved for national use
however the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii 1963 and iso s first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ascii s choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points
iso iec 646 like ascii was a 7 bit character set
it did not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries
escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general text processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway
because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso iec 646 a german french or swedish etc programmer using their national variant of iso iec 646 rather than ascii had to write and thus read something such as instead of c trigraph s were created to solve this problem for ansi c although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use
8 bit eventually as 8 16 and 32 bit computers began to replace 18 and 36 bit computers as the norm it became common to use an 8 bit byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended 8 bit relatives of ascii
in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original character mapping intact but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 i e 7 bit characters
most early home computer systems developed their own 8 bit character sets containing line drawing and game glyphs and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 31 with more graphics
the ibm pc defined code page 437 which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions
operating systems such as dos supported these code pages and manufacturers of ibm pc s supported them in hardware
digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set dec mcs for use in the popular vt220 terminal this was one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics
the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined a set both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets
the iso iec 8859 standard derived from the dec mcs finally provided a standard that most systems copied at least as accurately as they copied ascii but with many substitutions
a popular further extension designed by microsoft windows 1252 often mislabeled as iso 8859 1 added the typographic punctuation marks needed for attractive text printing
iso 8859 1 windows 1252 and the original 7 bit ascii were the most common character encodings until the late 2000s nowadays utf 8 is becoming more common
unicode unicode and the iso iec 10646 universal character set ucs have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso iec 8859 and ascii rapidly in many environments
while ascii is limited to 128 characters unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification using natural number s called code points and encoding to 8 16 or 32 bit binary formats called utf 8 utf 16 and utf 32
to allow backward compatibility the 128 ascii and 256 iso 8859 1 latin 1 characters are assigned unicode ucs code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards
therefore ascii can be considered a 7 bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of unicode ucs and ascii when prefixed with 0 as the eighth bit is valid utf 8
order ascii code order is also called asciibetical order
collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order collating sequence
the main deviations in ascii order are an intermediate order — readily implemented — converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values
naïve number sorting can be averted by zero filling all numbers e g 02 will sort before 10 as expected although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself

the bouncing ball animation below consists of these six frames
this animation moves at 10 frames per second
animation is the rapid display of a sequence of images to create an illusion of movement
the most common method of presenting animation is as a motion picture or video program although there are other methods
this type of presentation is usually accomplished with a camera and a projector or a computer viewing screen which can rapidly cycle through images in a sequence
animation can be made with either hand rendered art computer generated imagery or three dimensional objects e g puppets or clay figures or a combination of techniques
the position of each object in any particular image relates to the position of that object in the previous and following images so that the objects each appear to fluidly move independently of one another
the viewing device displays these images in rapid succession usually 24 25 or 30 frames per second
etymology from latin animātiō the act of bringing to life from animō to animate or give life to ātiō the act of
history early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of motion drawing can be found in paleolithic cave painting s where animals are depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion
a 5 000 year old earthen bowl found in iran in shahr i sokhta has five images of a goat painted along the sides
this has been claimed to be an example of early animation
however since no equipment existed to show the images in motion such a series of images can not be called animation in a true sense of the word
a chinese zoetrope type device had been invented in 180 ad
the phenakistoscope praxinoscope and the common flip book were early popular animation devices invented during the 19th century
these devices produced the appearance of movement from sequential drawings using technological means but animation did not really develop much further until the advent of cinematography
the cinématographe was a projector printer and camera in one machine that allowed moving pictures to be shown successfully on a screen which was invented by history s earliest film makers auguste and louis lumière in 1894
there is no single person who can be considered the creator of film animation as there were several people working at about the same time on projects which could be considered animation
georges méliès was a creator of special effect films and was generally regarded as one of the first people to use animation
he discovered the technique by accident when stopping his camera from rolling in order to change something in the scene and then continuing rolling the film
this idea was later known as stop motion animation
méliès camera broke down while shooting a bus driving by
when he had fixed the camera a hearse happened to be passing by just as méliès restarted rolling the film his end result was that he had managed to make a bus transform into a hearse
he was just one of the great contributors to the development of animation in the early years
the earliest surviving stop motion advertising film was an english short by arthur melbourne cooper called matches an appeal 1899
developed for the bryant and may matchsticks company it involved stop motion animation of wired together matches writing a patriotic call to action on a blackboard
j stuart blackton was possibly the first american film maker to use the techniques of stop motion and hand drawn animation
introduced to film making by edison he pioneered these concepts at the turn of the 20th century with his first copyrighted work dated 1900
several of his films among them the enchanted drawing 1900 and humorous phases of funny faces 1906 were film versions of blackton s lightning artist routine and utilized modified versions of méliès early stop motion techniques to make a series of blackboard drawings appear to move and reshape themselves
humorous phases of funny faces is regularly cited as the first true animated film and blackton is considered the first true animator
another french artist émile cohl began drawing cartoon strips and created a film in 1908 called fantasmagorie
the film largely consisted of a stick figure moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower
there were also sections of live action where the animator ’s hands would enter the scene
the film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto negative film which gave the picture a blackboard look
this makes fantasmagorie the first animated film created by using what came to be known as traditional hand drawn animation
the author of the first puppet animated film the beautiful lukanida 1912 was the russian born ethnically polish director wladyslaw starewicz known as ladislas starevich
following the successes of blackton and cohl many other artists began experimenting with animation
one such was winsor mccay a successful newspaper cartoonist who created detailed animations that required a team of artists and painstaking attention to detail
each frame was drawn on paper which invariably required backgrounds and characters to be redrawn and animated
among mccay s most noted films are little nemo 1911 gertie the dinosaur 1914 and the sinking of the lusitania 1918
the production of animated short films typically referred to as cartoons became an industry of its own during the 1910s and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters
the most successful early animation producer was john randolph bray who along with animator earl hurd patented the cel animation process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade
el apóstol spanish the apostle was a 1917 argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation and the world s first animated feature film
unfortunately a fire that destroyed producer frederico valle s film studio incinerated the only known copy of el apóstol and it is now considered a lost film
computer animation has become popular since toy story 1995 the first animated film completely made using this technique
in 2008 the animation market was worth us 68 4 billion
techniques traditional animation traditional animation also called cel animation or hand drawn animation was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century
the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings that are first drawn on paper
to create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it
the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cel s which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings
the completed character cels are photographed one by one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film
the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century
today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system
various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects
the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional 35 mm film and newer media such as digital video
the look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animator s work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years
some animation producers have used the term tradigital to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technology
examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio united states 1940 animal farm united kingdom 1954 and akira japan 1988
traditional animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include the lion king us 1994 sen to chihiro no kamikakushi spirited away japan 2001 and les triplettes de belleville france 2003
stop motion stop motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement
there are many different types of stop motion animation usually named after the medium used to create the animation
computer software is widely available to create this type of animation
computer animation computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer
this animation takes less time to produce than previous traditional animation
2d animation 2d animation figures are created and or edited on the computer using 2d bitmap graphics or created and edited using 2d vector graphics
this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques such as interpolated morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping
2d animation has many applications including analog computer animation flash animation and powerpoint animation
cinemagraph s are still photograph s in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated
3d animation 3d animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator
the animator starts by creating an external 3d mesh to manipulate
a mesh is a geometric configuration that gives the visual appearance of form to a 3d object or 3d environment
the mesh may have many vertices which are the geometric points which make up the mesh it is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh with weights
this process is called rigging and can be programmed for movement with keyframes
other techniques can be applied such as mathematical functions e g gravity particle simulations simulated fur or hair and effects such as fire and water simulations
these techniques fall under the category of 3d dynamics
terms 2d animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3d techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact
3d animation can create images that seem real to the viewer
other animation techniques other styles techniques and approaches awards as with any other form of media animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field
the original awards for animation were presented by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for animated shorts from the year 1932 during the 5th academy awards function
the first winner of the academy award was the short flowers and trees a production by walt disney productions and united artists
however the academy award for a feature length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001 and awarded during the 74th academy awards in 2002
it was won by the movie shrek produced by dreamworks and pacific data images
since then disney pixar have produced the most movies either to win or be nominated for the award
the list of both awards can be obtained here several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards bafta award for best animated film since 2006 césar award for best animated film since 2011 goya award for best animated film since 1989 japan academy prize for animation of the year since 2007
also since 2007 the asia pacific screen award for best animated feature film has been awarded at the asia pacific screen awards
since 2009 the european film awards have awarded the european film award for best animated film
the annie award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation
unlike the academy awards the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor
they were re organized in 1992 to create a new field for best animated feature
the 1990s winners were dominated by walt disney however newer studios led by pixar have now begun to consistently vie for this award

as the leader of the muse s apollon musegetes and director of their choir apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry
hermes created the lyre for him and the instrument became a common attribute of apollo
hymns sung to apollo were called paean s in hellenistic times especially during the 3rd century bce as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios titan god of the sun and his sister artemis similarly equated with selene titan goddess of the moon
in latin texts on the other hand joseph fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of apollo with sol among the augustan poets of the 1st century not even in the conjurations of aeneas and latinus in aeneid xii 161 – 215
apollo and helios sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century ce
etymology the etymology of apollo is uncertain
the spelling ἀπόλλων had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form απέλλων is more archaic derived from an earlier απέλjων
the name is certainly cognate with the doric month name απέλλαιος and the doric festival απελλαι
several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors
thus the greeks most often associated apollo s name with the greek verb ἀπόλλυμι apollymi to destroy
plato in cratylus connects the name with apolysis redeem with apolousis purification and with h aploun simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name and finally with aeiballon ever shooting
hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric απέλλα apella which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation σηκός sekos fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds
following the tradition of these ancient greek folk etymologies in the doric dialect the word originally meant wall fence from animals and later assembly within the agora
in the ancient macedonian language pella means stone and some toponyms are derived from this word pella capital of ancient macedonia pellini pallini
a number of non greek etymologies have been suggested for the name the form apaliunas d is attested as a god of wilusa in a treaty between alaksandu of wilusa and the hittite great king muwatalli ii c 1280 bce
alaksandu could be paris alexander of ilion whose name is greek
the hittite testimony reflects an early form which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot απειλων with doric απελλων
a luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter
among the proposed etymologies is the hurrian and hittite divinity aplu who was widely invoked during the plague years
aplu it is suggested comes from the akkadian aplu enlil meaning the son of enlil a title that was given to the god nergal who was linked to shamash babylonian god of the sun
greco roman epithets apollo like other greek deities had a number of epithet s applied to him reflecting the variety of roles duties and aspects ascribed to the god
however while apollo has a great number of appellations in greek myth only a few occur in latin literature chief among them phoebus φοίβος phoibos literally radiant which was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans in apollo s role as the god of light
as sun god and god of light apollo was also known by the epithets aegletes αἰγλήτης aiglētēs from αἴγλη light of the sun helius ἥλιος helios literally sun phanaeus φαναῖος phanaios literally giving or bringing light and lyceus λύκειος lukeios from proto greek λύκη light
the meaning of the epithet lyceus later became associated apollo s mother leto who was the patron goddess of lycia λυκία and who was identified with the wolf λύκος earning him the epithets lycegenes λυκηγενής lukēgenēs literally born of a wolf or born of lycia and lycoctonus λυκοκτόνος lukoktonos from λύκος wolf and κτείνειν to kill
as god of the sun the romans referred to apollo as sol literally sun in latin
in association with his birthplace mount cynthus on the island of delos apollo was called cynthius κύνθιος kunthios literally cynthian cynthogenes κύνθογενης kunthogenēs literally born of cynthus and delius δήλιος delios literally delian
as artemis s twin apollo had the epithet didymaeus διδυμαιος didumaios from δίδυμος twin
apollo was worshipped as actiacus ἄκτιακός aktiakos literally actian delphinius δελφίνιος delphinios literally delphic and pythius πύθιος puthios from πυθώ pūthō the area around delphi after actium ἄκτιον and delphi δελφοί respectively two of his principal places of worship
an etiology in the homeric hymns associated the epithet delphinius with dolphins
he was worshipped as acraephius ἀκραιφιος akraiphios literally acraephian or acraephiaeus ἀκραιφιαίος akraiphiaios literally acraephian in the boeotia n town of acraephia ἀκραιφία reputedly founded by his son acraepheus and as smintheus σμινθεύς smintheus sminthian — that is of the town of sminthos or sminthe near the troad town of hamaxitus
the epithet smintheus has historically been confused with σμίνθος mouse in association with apollo s role as a god of disease
for this he was also known as parnopius παρνόπιος parnopios from πάρνοψ locust and to the romans as culicarius from latin culicārius of midges
in apollo s role as a healer his appellations included acesius ἀκέσιος akesios from ἄκεσις healing acestor ἀκέστωρ akestōr literally healer paean παιάν paiān from παίειν to touch and iatrus ἰατρός iātros literally physician
acesius was the epithet of apollo worshipped in elis where he had a temple in the agora
the romans referred to apollo as medicus literally physician in latin in this respect
a temple was dedicated to apollo medicus at rome probably next to the temple of bellona
as a protector and founder apollo had the epithets alexicacus ἀλεξίκακος alexikakos literally warding off evil apotropaeus ἀποτρόπαιος apotropaios from ἀποτρέπειν to avert and epicurius ἐπικούριος epikourios from ἐπικουρέειν to aid and archegetes ἀρχηγέτης arkhēgetēs literally founder clarius κλάριος klārios from doric κλάρος allotted lot and genetor γενέτωρ genetōr literally ancestor
to the romans he was known in this capacity as averruncus from latin āverruncare to avert
he was also called agyieus ἀγυιεύς aguīeus from ἄγυια street for his role in protecting roads and homes and as nomius νόμιος nomios literally pastoral and nymphegetes νυμφηγέτης numphēgetēs from νύμφη nymph and ἡγέτης leader in his role as a protector of shepherds and pastoral life
in his role as god of prophecy and truth apollo had the epithets manticus μαντικός mantikos literally prophetic leschenorius λεσχηνόριος leskhēnorios from λεσχήνωρ converser and loxias λοξίας loxias from λέγειν to say
the epithet loxias has historically been associated with λοξός ambiguous
in this respect the romans called him coelispex from latin coelum sky and specere to look at
the epithet iatromantis ἰατρομάντις iātromantis from ὶατρός physician and μάντις prophet refers to both his role as a god of healing and of prophecy
as god of music and arts apollo had the epithet musagetes doric μουσαγέτας mousāgetās or musegetes μουσηγέτης mousēgetēs from μούσα muse and ἡγέτης leader
as a god of archery apollo was known as aphetor ἀφήτωρ aphētōr from ὰφίημι to let loose or aphetorus ἀφητόρος aphētoros of the same origin argyrotoxus ἀργυρότοξος argurotoxos literally with silver bow hecaërgus ἑκάεργος hekaergos literally far shooting and hecebolus ἑκηβόλος hekēbolos literally far shooting
the romans referred to apollo as articenens bow carrying
apollo was called ismenius ἰσμηνιός ismēnios literally of ismenus after ismenus the son of amphion and niobe whom he struck with an arrow
celtic epithets and cult titles apollo was worshipped throughout the roman empire
in the traditionally celtic lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god
he was often equated with celtic gods of similar character
origins the cult centers of apollo in greece delphi and delos date from the 8th century bce
the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis apollo s twin sister
at delphi apollo was venerated as the slayer of pytho
for the greeks apollo was all the gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods
in archaic greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing
in classical greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil
walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship which he termed a dorian northwest greek component a cretan minoan component and a syro hittite component
from his eastern origin apollo brought the art of inspection from symbols and omina σημεία και τέρατα semeia kai terata and of the observation of the omen s of the days
the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced from anatolia
the ritualism belonged to apollo from the beginning
the greeks created the legalism the supervision of the orders of the gods and the demand for moderation and harmony
apollo became the god of shining youth the protector of music spiritual life moderation and perceptible order
the improvement of the old anatolia n god and his elevation to an intellectual sphere may be considered an achievement of the greek people
healer and god protector from evil the function of apollo as a healer is connected with paean παιών παιήων the physician of the gods in the iliad who seems to come from a more primitive religion
paeοn is probably connected with the mycenean pa ja wo but the etymology is the only evidence
he did not have a separate cult but he was the personification of the holy magic song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease
later the greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song paean παιάν
the magicians were also called seer doctors ιατρομάντεις and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god apollo at the oracles
in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the terrible vedic god of disease rudra
he sends a terrible plague λοιμός to the achaeans
the god who sends a disease can also prevent from it therefore when it stops they make a purifying ceremony and offer him an hecatomb to ward off evil
when the oath of his priest appeases they pray and with a song they call their own god the beautiful paean
some common epithets of apollo as a healer are paion παιών touching epikourios επικουρώ help oulios ουλή cured wound and loimios λοiμός plague
in classical times his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil and was therefore called apotropaios αποτρέπω to divert and alexikakos αλέξω κακό defend throw away the evil
in later writers the word usually spelled paean becomes a mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as a god of healing
homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph
such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollo s son asclepius the healer
about the 4th century bce the paean became merely a formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered
it was in this way that apollo had become recognised as the god of music
apollo s role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when a fleet left the harbour and also after a victory had been won
dorian origin the connection with dorians and their initiation festival apella i is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars but it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella pella stone
stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi omphalos
the homeric hymn represents apollo as a northern intruder
his arrival must have occurred during the dark ages that followed the destruction of the mycenaean civilization and his conflict with gaia mother earth was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent python
the earth deity had power over the ghostly world and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle
the older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated
a female dragon named delphyne δελφύς womb who is obviously connected with delphi and apollo delphinios and a male serpent typhon τύφειν smoke the adversary of zeus in the titanomachy who the narrators confused with python
python was the good daemon αγαθός δαίμων of the temple as it appears in minoan religion but she was represented as a dragon as often happens in northern european folklore as well as in the east
apollo and his sister artemis can bring death with their arrows
the conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings or magicians is common in germanic and norse mythology
in greek mythology artemis was the leader ηγεμόνη hegemone of the nymphs who had similar functions with the nordic elves
the elf shot originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves but it was later attested denoting arrow heads which were used by witches to harm people and also for healing rituals
the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo
the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva
rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiba is a healer physician god
however the indo european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult
minoan origin it seems an oracular cult existed in delphi from the mycenaean ages
in historical times the priests of delphi were called labryaden the double axe men which indicates minoan origin
the double axe λάβρυς labrys was the holy symbol of the cretan labyrinth
the homeric hymn adds that apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices
apollo delphinios was a sea god especially worshiped in crete and in the islands and his name indicates his connection with delphi and the holy serpent delphyne womb
apollo s sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis diktynna the minoan mistress of the animals
in her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the mister of the animals a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute
we do n t know his original name but it seems that he was absorbed by the more powerful apollo who stood by the mistress of the animals becoming her brother
the old oracles in delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration prophecy existed in the temple
this led some scholars to the conclusion that pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries according to the local tradition
in that regard the mythical seeress sibyl of anatolia n origin with her ecstatic art looks unrelated to the oracle itself
however the greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel leaves which seem to be confirmed by recent studies
plato describes the priestesses of delphi and dodona as frenzied women obsessed by mania μανία frenzy a greek word connected with mantis μάντις prophet
frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the near east as mari in the second millennium bc
although crete had contacts with mari from 2000 bc there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the minoan and mycenean ages
it is more probable that this art was introduced later from anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to delphi and dormant in several areas of greece
anatolian origin a non greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship
the name of apollo s mother leto has lydia n origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor
the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines
omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyro babylon ian texts and these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites
in a hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a babylonian priestess for a certain purification
a similar story is mentioned by plutarch
he writes that the creta n seer epimenides purified athens after the pollution brought by the alcmeonidae and that the seer s expertise in sacrifice s and reform of funeral practices were of great help to solon in his reform of the athenian state
the story indicates that epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of asia and proves together with the homeric hymn that crete had a resisting religion up to the historical times
it seems that these rituals were dormant in greece and they were reinforced when the greeks migrated to anatolia
homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war
he is pictured as a terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods
the god seems to be related to appaliunas a tutelary god of wilusa troy in asia minor but the word is not complete
the stones found in front of the gates of homer ic troy were the symbols of apollo
the greeks gave to him the name αγυιεύς agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column
however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day sibutu indicates a babylonian origin
the late bronze age from 1700 to 1200 bce hittite and hurrian aplu was a god of plague invoked during plague years
here we have an apotropaic situation where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it
aplu meaning the son of was a title given to the god nergal who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash
homer interprets apollo as a terrible god δεινός θεός who brings death and disease with his arrows but who can also heal possessing a magic art that separates him from the other greek gods
in iliad his priest prays to apollo smintheus the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats
all these functions including the function of the healer god paean who seems to have mycenean origin are fused in the cult of apollo
oracular cult unusually among the olympic deities apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi
in cult practice delian apollo and pythian apollo the apollo of delphi were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality
apollo s cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about 650 bce
apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity
oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites
in the 2nd and 3rd century ce those at didyma and clarus pronounced the so called theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all encompassing highest deity
in the 3rd century apollo fell silent
julian the apostate 359 61 tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed
oracular shrines apollo had a famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in clarus and branchidae
his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponym ic epithet abaeus apollon abaios was important enough to be consulted by croesus
his oracular shrines include oracles were also given by sons of apollo
mythology birth when zeus wife hera discovered that leto was pregnant and that zeus was the father she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma
in her wanderings leto found the newly created floating island of delos which was neither mainland nor a real island
she gave birth there and was accepted by the people offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city
afterwards zeus secured delos to the bottom of the ocean
this island later became sacred to apollo
it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to prevent leto from going into labor
the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace nine yards 8 m long of amber
mythographers agree that artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of apollo or that artemis was born one day before apollo on the island of ortygia and that she helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo
apollo was born on the seventh day of the month thargelion — according to delian tradition — or of the month bysios — according to delphian tradition
the seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him
youth four days after his birth apollo killed the chthonic dragon python which lived in delphi beside the castalian spring
this was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at delphi to give her prophecies
hera sent the serpent to hunt leto to her death across the world
to protect his mother apollo begged hephaestus for a bow and arrows
after receiving them apollo cornered python in the sacred cave at delphi
apollo killed python but had to be punished for it since python was a child of gaia
hera then sent the giant tityos to kill leto
this time apollo was aided by his sister artemis in protecting their mother
during the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus
there he was pegged to the rock floor covering an area of where a pair of vulture s feasted daily on his liver
trojan war apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment during the trojan war in retribution for agamemnon s insult to chryses a priest of apollo whose daughter chryseis had been captured
he demanded her return and the achaeans complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad
in the iliad when diomedes injured aeneas apollo rescued him
first aphrodite tried to rescue aeneas but diomedes injured her as well
aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by apollo who took him to pergamos a sacred spot in troy
apollo aided paris in the killing of achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into achilles heel
one interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for achilles sacrilege in murdering troilus the god s own son by hecuba on the very altar of the god s own temple
admetus when zeus struck down apollo s son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting hippolytus from the dead transgressing themis by stealing hades s subjects apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus
apollo would have been banished to tartarus forever but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor as punishment due to the intercession of his mother leto
during this time he served as shepherd for king admetus of pherae in thessaly
admetus treated apollo well and in return the god conferred great benefits on admetus
apollo helped admetus win alcestis the daughter of king pelias and later convinced the fates to let admetus live past his time if another took his place
but when it came time for admetus to die his parents whom he had assumed would gladly die for him refused to cooperate
instead alcestis took his place but heracles managed to persuade thanatos the god of death to return her to the world of the living
niobe niobe the queen of thebes and wife of amphion boasted of her superiority to leto because she had fourteen children niobids seven male and seven female while leto had only two
apollo killed her sons and artemis her daughters
apollo and artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them though according to some versions of the myth a number of the niobids were spared chloris usually
amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge
a devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept
her tears formed the river achelous
zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them
consorts and children love affairs ascribed to apollo are a late development in greek mythology
their vivid anecdotal qualities have made favorites some of them of painters since the renaissance so that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination
female lovers daphne was a nymph daughter of the river god peneus who had scorned apollo
the myth explains the connection of apollo with δάφνη daphnē the laurel whose leaves his priestess employed at delphi
in ovid s metamorphoses phoebus apollo chaffs cupid for toying with a weapon more suited to a man whereupon cupid wounds him with a golden dart simultaneously however cupid shoots a leaden arrow into daphne causing her to be repulsed by apollo
following a spirited chase by apollo daphne prays to her father peneus for help and he changes her into the laurel tree sacred to apollo
artemis daphnaia who had her temple among the lacedemonians at a place called hypsoi in antiquity on the slopes of mount cnacadion near the spartan frontier had her own sacred laurel trees
at eretria the identity of an excavated 7th and 6th century temple to apollo daphnephoros apollo laurel bearer or carrying off daphne a place where the citizens are to take the oath is identified in inscriptions
leucothea was daughter of orchamus and sister of clytia
she fell in love with apollo who disguised himself as leucothea s mother to gain entrance to her chambers
clytia jealous of her sister because she wanted apollo for herself told orchamus the truth betraying her sister s trust and confidence in her
enraged orchamus ordered leucothea to be buried alive
apollo refused to forgive clytia for betraying his beloved and a grieving clytia wilted and slowly died
apollo changed her into an incense plant either heliotrope or sunflower which follows the sun every day
marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well
zeus made her choose between them and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo being immortal would tire of her when she grew old
castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved
she fled from him and dove into the spring at delphi at the base of mt parnassos which was then named after her
water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses
in the last oracle is mentioned that the water which could speak has been lost for ever
by cyrene apollo had a son named aristaeus who became the patron god of cattle fruit trees hunting husbandry and bee keeping
he was also a culture hero and taught humanity dairy skills the use of nets and traps in hunting and how to cultivate olives
hecuba was the wife of king priam of troy and apollo had a son with her named troilus
an oracle prophesied that troy would not be defeated as long as troilus reached the age of twenty alive
he was ambushed and killed by achilleus
cassandra was daughter of hecuba and priam and troilus half sister
apollo fell in love with cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her but she rejected him afterwards
enraged apollo indeed gifted her with the ability to know the future with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her
coronis was daughter of phlegyas king of the lapiths
pregnant with asclepius coronis fell in love with ischys son of elatus
a crow informed apollo of the affair
when first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black where they were previously white as a punishment for spreading untruths
when he found out the truth he sent his sister artemis to kill coronis in other stories apollo himself had killed coronis
as a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths
apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur chiron to raise
phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the temple of apollo at delphi
apollo then killed him for what he did
in euripides play ion apollo fathered ion by creusa wife of xuthus
creusa left ion to die in the wild but apollo asked hermes to save the child and bring him to the oracle at delphi where he was raised by a priestess
acantha was the spirit of the acanthus tree and apollo had one of his other liaisons with her
upon her death apollo transformed her into a sun loving herb
according to the biblioteca the library of mythology mis attributed to apollodorus he fathered the corybantes on the muse thalia
consorts and children extended list male lovers hyacinth or hyacinthus was one of apollo s male lovers
he was a sparta n prince beautiful and athletic
the pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by apollo was blown off course by the jealous zephyrus and struck hyacinthus in the head killing him instantly
apollo is said to be filled with grief out of hyacinthus blood apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with άί άί meaning alas
the festival of hyacinthus was a celebration of sparta
another male lover was cyparissus a descendant of heracles
apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth
cyparissus asked apollo to let his tears fall forever
apollo granted the request by turning him into the cypress named after him which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk
other male lovers of apollo include apollo s lyre hermes was born on mount cyllene in arcadia
the story is told in the homeric hymn to hermes
his mother maia had been secretly impregnated by zeus
maia wrapped the infant in blankets but hermes escaped while she was asleep
hermes ran to thessaly where apollo was grazing his cattle
the infant hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks
in the cave he found a tortoise and killed it then removed the insides
he used one of the cow s intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre
apollo complained to maia that her son had stolen his cattle but hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in so maia refused to believe apollo s claim
zeus intervened and claiming to have seen the events sided with apollo
hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented
apollo a god of music fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre
hence apollo then became a master of the lyre
apollo in the oresteia in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war and cassandra a prophetess of apollo
apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnon s son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover
orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes furies female personifications of vengeance
apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage
they invade his temple and he says that the matter should be brought before athena
apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollo s supplicant
apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules with apollo
other stories apollo killed the aloadae when they attempted to storm mt olympus
callimachus sang that apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the hyperboreans during the winter months
apollo turned cephissus into a sea monster
another contender for the birthplace of apollo is the cretan islands of paximadia
musical contests panonce pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge apollo the god of the kithara to a trial of skill
tmolus the mountain god was chosen to umpire
pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present
then apollo struck the strings of his lyre
tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and all but midas agreed with the judgment
he dissented and questioned the justice of the award
apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey
marsyasapollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague bringing death dealing arrows marsyas was a satyr who challenged apollo to a contest of music
he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy
the contest was judged by the muse s after they each performed both were deemed equal until apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time
as apollo played the lyre this was easy to do
marsyas could not do this as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time
apollo was declared the winner because of this
apollo flayed marsyas alive in a cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god
he then nailed marsyas shaggy skin to a nearby pine tree
marsyas blood turned into the river marsyas
another variation is that apollo played his instrument the lyre upside down
marsyas could not do this with his instrument the flute and so apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive
cinyrasapollo also had a lyre playing contest with cinyras his son who committed suicide when he lost
roman apollo the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks
as a quintessentially greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus
there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus
on the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s bce apollo s first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare
during the second punic war in 212 bce the ludi apollinares apollonian games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marcius
in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome
after the battle of actium which was fought near a sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollo s temple dedicated a portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour
he also erected a new temple to the god on the palatine hill
sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in 17 bce to celebrate the dawn of a new era
festivals the chief apollonian festivals were the boedromia carneia carpiae daphnephoria delia hyacinthia metageitnia pyanepsia pythia and thargelia
attributes and symbols apollo s most common attributes were the bow and arrow
other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre the plectrum and the sword
another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers
the pythian games were held in apollo s honor every four years at delphi
the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games
the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos
animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swan s cicada s symbolizing music and song hawk s raven s crow s snakes referencing apollo s function as the god of prophecy mice and griffin s mythical eagle – lion hybrids of eastern origin
as god of colonization apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization 750 – 550 bce
according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadia n colonists found the city of troy
however this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention a minor asian god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars
in this interpretation apollo s title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the god s supposed link with wolves possibly a folk etymology
in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and reason — characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder
the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian
however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus
this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase
apollo is often associated with the golden mean
this is the greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony
apollo in the arts apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance
the earliest greek word for a statue is delight άγαλμα agalma and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision
greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined
the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought
the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity
the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment
the statues of apollo embody beauty balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world
the evolution of the greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal kouros type in early archaic period to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in late archaic period
in classical greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole a method created by polykleitos
finally praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities and his masterpieces are a mixture of naturalism with stylization
art and greek philosophy the evolution of the greek art seems to go parallel with the greek philosophical conceptions which changed from the natural philosophy of thales to the metaphysical theory of pythagoras
thales searched for a simple material form directly perceptible by the senses behind the appearances of things and his theory is also related to the older animism
this was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life through unnaturally simplified forms
pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation
the forms on earth are imperfect imitations εικών ikon image of the celestial world of numbers
his ideas had a great influence on post archaic art and the greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation that would lead to the esthetic perfection
in classical greece anaxagoras asserted that a divine reason mind gave order to the seeds of the universe and plato extended the greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms ideai ideas
the forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas
the greek words ida οίδα know and idos είδος species have the same root as the word idea ιδέα indicating how the greek mind moved from the gift of the senses to the principles beyond the senses
the artists in plato s time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization
the greek sculptors considered the senses more important and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual
archaic sculpture kouros male youth is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in greece
this type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of apollo
the first statues are certainly still and formal
the formality of their stance seems to be related with the egypt ian precedent but it was accepted for a good reason
the sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is and embodied the archaic smile of good manners the firm and springy step the balance of the body dignity and youthful happiness
when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods
the adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions and also due to the general greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented
these forms expressed immortality
apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order his shrine in delphi has the inscription nothing in excess
in the first large scale depictions during the early archaic period 640 – 580 bc the artists tried to draw one s attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses but as being full of life
the greeks maintained until late in their civilization an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive
this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself
a fine example is the statue of the sacred gate kouros which was found at the cemetery of dipylon in athens dipylon kouros
the statue is the thing in itself and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity
according to the greek tradition the dipylon master was named daedalus and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body giving the impression that the statues could move
it is considered that he created also the new york kouros which is the oldest fully preserved statue of kouros type and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself
the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality is sanctified in the homeric poems and in greek myths in stories of the god hephaestus phaistos and the mythic daedalus the builder of the labyrinth that made images which moved of their own accord
this kind of art goes back to the minoan period when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment
these free standing statues were usually marble but also the form rendered in limestone bronze ivory and terracotta
the earliest examples of life sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos
such statues were found across the greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone
the last stage in the development of the kouros type is the late archaic period 520 – 485 bc in which the greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole
ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo
it was found in piraeus the harbour of athens
the statue originally held the bow in its left hand and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand
it probably comes from north eastern peloponnesus
the emphasis is given in anatomy and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion and beauty relative to proportions which appear mostly in post archaic art
the statue throws some light on an artistic centre which with an independently developed harder simpler and heavier style restricts ionia n influence in athens
finally this is the germ from which the art of polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later
classical sculpture in the next century which is the beginning of the classical period it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else consisted of symmetry and proportions
the artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment myron which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant minoan element
anatomy and geometry are fused in one and each does something to the other
the greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions just as they sought some reality behind appearances
polykleitos in his canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements materials but of the parts that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole
it seems that he was influenced by the theories of pythagoras
the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm
the type is represented by neo attic imperial roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century modelled upon a supposed greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century bce in a style similar to works of polykleitos but more archaic
the apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm of which in the louvre example a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps
though the proportions were always important in greek art the appeal of the greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone
the statues of apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the minoan period and in the beliefs of the first greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze age
just as the greeks saw the mountains forests sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form and the form of a work of art
spiritual life is incorporated in matter when it is given artistic form
just as in the arts the greeks sought some reality behind appearances so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same
artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect as to the whole sentient self
things as we see them and as they really are are one that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity
pediments and friezes in the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base
the siphnian treasury in delphi was one of the first greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling
the pediment shows the story of heracles stealing apollo s tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration
their two figures hold the centre
in the pediment of the temple of zeus in olympia the single figure of apollo is dominating the scene
these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake
they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space but only as parts in a larger whole
while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs
in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield
the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy
hellenistic greece rome apollo as a handsome beardless young man is often depicted with a kithara as apollo citharoedus or bow in his hand or reclining on a tree the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types
the apollo belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans from the renaissance through the 19th century
the marble is a hellenistic or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares made between 350 and 325 bce
the life size so called adonis found in 1780 on the site of a villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars
in the late 2nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem roman thysdrus he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even a god s divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire
another haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse
the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the 3rd century bce to depict alexander the great
some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed
modern reception apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature
percy bysshe shelley composed a hymn of apollo 1820 and the god s instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinsky s apollon musagète 1927 – 1928
in discussion of the arts a distinction is sometimes made between the apollonian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity
friedrich nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable
carl jung s apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over intellectualise and maintain emotional distance

in the quarterfinals at the us open agassi lost a 3 hour 33 minute epic match with sampras 7 – 6 6 – 7 6 – 7 6 – 7 with no breaks of serve during the 48 game match
despite the setback agassi finished 2001 ranked world no 3 becoming the only male tennis player to finish a year ranked in the top 3 in three different decades 1980s — finishing world no 3 in 1988 and no 7 in 1989 1990s — finishing world no 4 in 1990 no 10 in 1991 no 9 in 1992 no 2 in 1994 and 1995 no 8 in 1996 no 6 in 1998 and no 1 in 1999 2000s — finishing world no 6 in 2000 no 3 in 2001 no 2 in 2002 no 4 in 2003 no 8 in 2004 and no 7 in 2005
he also was the oldest player age 31 to finish in the top three since 32 year old connors finished at world no 2 in 1984
2002 opened with disappointment for agassi as injury forced him to skip the australian open where he was a two time defending champion
the last duel between agassi and sampras came in the final of the us open which sampras won in four sets and left sampras with a 20 – 14 edge in their 34 career meetings
the match was the last of sampras s career
agassi s us open finish along with his masters series victories in key biscayne rome and madrid helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year end world no 2 at 32 years and 8 months
in 2003 agassi won the eighth and final grand slam title of his career at the australian open where he beat rainer schüttler in straight sets in the final

agassi s winning streak continued to 20 after winning his first two matches at the 2004 edition of that tournament before bowing to agustín calleri
with the victory agassi became the youngest 19 years old and oldest 32 winner of the key biscayne tournament
on april 28 2003 he recaptured the world no 1 ranking after a quarterfinal victory over xavier malisse at the queen s club championships to become the oldest top ranked male player since the atp rankings began at 33 years and 13 days
he had held the world no 1 ranking for two weeks when lleyton hewitt took it back on may 12 2003

during his career agassi held the world no 1 ranking for a total of 101 weeks
agassi s ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from many events
he did manage to reach the us open semifinals where he lost to juan carlos ferrero and surrendered his world no 1 ranking to ferrero
at the year end tennis masters cup agassi lost in the final to federer and finished the year ranked world no 4
at age 33 he was the oldest player to rank in the top 5 since connors at age 35 was world no 4 in 1987
2004 – 2006 in 2004 agassi began the year with a five set loss in the semifinals of the australian open to marat safin the loss ended agassi s 26 match winning streak at the event a record that still stands

he lost to jarkko nieminen in the first round of the french open
he won his fourth title in los angeles and reached the final of the rogers cup before falling to world no 2 rafael nadal
agassi s 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the us open final
after beating răzvan sabău and ivo karlović in straight sets and tomáš berdych in four sets agassi won three consecutive five set matches to advance to the final
the most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over james blake where he rallied from two sets down to win 7 – 6 in the fifth set

the austroasiatic austro asiatic languages in recent classifications synonymous with mon – khmer are a large language family of continental southeast asia also scattered throughout india bangladesh and the southern border of china
the name austroasiatic comes from the latin words for south and asia hence south asia
among these languages only khmer vietnamese and mon have a long established recorded history and only vietnamese and khmer have official status in vietnam and cambodia respectively
the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups
ethnologue identifies 168 austroasiatic languages
these form thirteen established families plus perhaps shompen which is poorly attested as a fourteenth which have traditionally been grouped into two as mon – khmer and munda
however recent classifications have abandoned mon – khmer as a taxon either reducing it in scope or making it synonymous with the larger family
austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across india bangladesh and southeast asia separated by regions where other languages are spoken
they appear to be the autochthonous language s of southeast asia with the neighboring indic tai dravidian austronesian and tibeto burman languages being the result of later migrations sidwell blench 2011
morphology the austroasiatic languages are well known for having a sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of a reduced minor syllable plus a full syllable
many of them also have infix es
proto language much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto mon – khmer in harry l shorto s mon – khmer comparative dictionary
little work has been done on the munda languages which are not well documented with their demotion from a primary branch proto mon – khmer becomes synonymous with proto austroasiatic
sidwell 2005 reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto mon – khmer as follows this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for
is better preserved in the katuic languages which sidwell has specialized in
sidwell 2011 suggests that the likely homeland of austroasiatic is the middle mekong in the area of the bahnaric and katuic languages approximately where modern laos thailand and cambodia come together and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed dating to perhaps 4000 bce
classification linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the mon – khmer languages of southeast asia northeast india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh
however no evidence for this classification has ever been published
each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade
by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic is debated
in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accept traditional mon – khmer as a valid unit
however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore can not be evaluated by peer review
in addition there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra diffloth the chamic languages of vietnam and the land dayak languages of borneo adelaar 1995
sidwell 2009 2011 sidwell 2009a in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are well known enough to exclude loan words finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic
he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence
sidwell blench 2011 discuss this proposal in more detail and note that there is good evidence for a khasi – palaungic node which could also possibly be closely related to khmuic
if this would the case sidwell blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward
sidwell blench 2011 suggest shompen as an additional branch and believe that a vieto katuic connection is worth investigating
in general however the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed since proto austroasiatic speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly
gérard diffloth 2005 diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations though like other classifications the evidence has not been published
as a schematic we have or in more detail this family tree is consistent with recent studies of migration of y chromosomal haplogroup o2a1 m95
however the dates obtained from dna studies are several times older than that given by linguists
the route map of the people with haplogroup o2a1 m95 speaking this language can be seen in this link
ilia peiros 2004 peiros is a lexicostatistic classification based on percentages of shared vocabulary
this means that a language may appear to be more distantly related than it actually is due to language contact
indeed when sidwell 2009a replicated peiros s study with languages known well enough to account for loans he did not find the internal branching structure below
diffloth 1974 diffloth s widely cited original classification now abandoned by diffloth himself is used in encyclopædia britannica and — except for the breakup of southern mon – khmer — in ethnologue
writing systems other than latin based alphabets many austroasiatic languages are written with the ancient khmer alphabet thai alphabet and lao alphabet

afroasiatic afro asiatic also known as hamito semitic chamito semitic is a large language family including 300 or so living languages
afroasiatic languages are spoken predominantly in the middle east north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel
more than 300 million people speak an afroasiatic language
the most widely spoken afroasiatic language is arabic including literary arabic and the spoken colloquial varieties with about 200 to 230 million native speakers spoken mostly in the middle east and parts of north africa
berber including all its varieties is spoken in morocco algeria libya tunisia northern mali and northern niger by about 25 to 35 million people
other widely spoken afroasiatic languages are hausa the dominant language of northern nigeria and southern niger spoken as a first language by 25 million people and used as a lingua franca by another 20 million across the sahel amharic and oromo of ethiopia with 25 million speakers apiece somali spoken by 15 million people in greater somalia and modern hebrew spoken by about seven million people worldwide
in addition to languages spoken today afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages such as ancient egyptian akkadian and biblical hebrew
etymology the afroasiatic language family was originally referred to as ham ito sem itic a term introduced in the 1860s by the german scholar karl richard lepsius
the name was later popularized by friedrich müller in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft wien 1876 88
the term afroasiatic often now spelled as afro asiatic was later coined by maurice delafosse 1914
however it did not come into general use until joseph greenberg 1963 formally proposed its adoption
in doing so greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that afroasiatic was the only language family that was represented transcontinentally in both africa and asia
individual scholars have also called the family erythraean tucker 1966 and lisramic hodge 1972
in lieu of hamito semitic the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term afrasian meaning half african half asiatic in reference to the geographic distribution of the phylum s constituent languages
the term hamito semitic remains in use in the academic traditions of some european countries
distribution and branches the afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches while there is general agreement on these six families there are some points of disagreement among linguists who study afroasiatic
in particular classification history in the 9th century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret in algeria was the first to link two branches of afroasiatic together he perceived a relationship between berber and semitic
he knew of semitic through his study of arabic hebrew and aramaic
in the course of the 19th century europeans also began suggesting such relationships
in 1844 theodor benfey suggested a language family consisting of semitic berber and cushitic calling the latter ethiopic
in the same year t n newman suggested a relationship between semitic and hausa but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty
friedrich müller named the traditional hamito semitic family in 1876 in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft
he defined it as consisting of a semitic group plus a hamitic group containing egyptian berber and cushitic he excluded the chadic group
these classifications relied in part on non linguistic anthropological and racial arguments that have largely been discredited see hamitic hypothesis
leo reinisch 1909 proposed linking cushitic and chadic while urging a more distant affinity to egyptian and semitic thus foreshadowing greenberg but his suggestion found little resonance
marcel cohen 1924 rejected the idea of a distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa a chadic language in his comparative hamito semitic vocabulary
joseph greenberg 1950 strongly confirmed cohen s rejection of hamitic added and sub classified the chadic branch and proposed the new name afroasiatic for the family
nearly all scholars have accepted greenberg s classification
in 1969 harold fleming proposed that what had previously been known as western cushitic is an independent branch of afroasiatic suggesting for it the new name omotic
this proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance
several scholars including harold fleming and robert hetzron have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in cushitic
subgrouping little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of afroasiatic semitic egyptian berber chadic cushitic and omotic
however christopher ehret 1979 harold fleming 1981 and joseph greenberg 1981 all agree that the omotic branch split from the rest first
otherwise position among the world s languages afroasiatic is one of the four language families of africa identified by joseph greenberg in his book the languages of africa 1963
it is the only one that extends outside of africa via the semitic branch
there are no generally accepted relations between afroasiatic and any other language family
however several proposals grouping afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made
the best known of these are the following date of afroasiatic the earliest written evidence of an afroasiatic language is an ancient egyptian inscription of c 3400 bc 5 400 years ago
symbols on gerzean pottery resembling egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c 4000 bc suggesting a still earlier possible date
this gives us a minimum date for the age of afroasiatic
however ancient egyptian is highly divergent from proto afroasiatic trombetti 1905 1 – 2 and considerable time must have elapsed in between them
estimates of the date at which the proto afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely
they fall within a range between approximately 7500 bc 9 500 years ago and approximately 16 000 bc 18 000 years ago
according to igor m diakonoff 1988 33n proto afroasiatic was spoken c 10 000 bc
according to christopher ehret 2002 35 – 36 proto afroasiatic was spoken c 11 000 bc at the latest and possibly as early as c 16 000 bc
these dates are older than dates associated with most other proto languages
afroasiatic urheimat the term afroasiatic urheimat urheimat meaning original homeland in german refers to the hypothetical place where proto afroasiatic speakers lived in a single linguistic community or complex of communities before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages
afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in the middle east north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel
there is no agreement on when and where this urheimat existed though the language is generally believed to have originated somewhere in or near the region stretching from the levant near east to the area between the eastern sahara and the horn of africa including egypt ethiopia and sudan
similarities in grammar and syntax widespread though not universal features of the afroasiatic languages include one of the most remarkable shared features among the afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation see table above with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with ʔ t n y and in particular a pattern whereby third singular masculine y is opposed to third singular feminine and second singular t
tonal language s appear in the omotic chadic and cushitic branches of afroasiatic according to ehret 1996
the semitic berber and egyptian branches do not use tones phonemically
shared vocabulary following are some examples of afroasiatic cognate s including ten pronoun s three noun s and three verb s there are two etymological dictionaries of afroasiatic one by christopher ehret and one by vladimir orel and olga stolbova
the two dictionaries disagree on almost everything

andorra officially the principality of andorra also called the principality of the valleys of andorra is a landlocked microstate in southwestern europe located in the eastern pyrenees mountains and bordered by spain and france
it is the sixth smallest nation in europe having an area of and an estimated population of 85 000 in 2012
its capital andorra la vella is the highest capital city in europe at an elevation of above sea level
the official language is catalan although spanish portuguese and french are also commonly spoken
created under a charter in 988 the present principality was formed in 1278
it is known as a principality as it is a monarchy headed by two co princes – the bishop of urgell and the president of france
andorra is a prosperous country mainly because of its tourism industry which services an estimated 10 2 million visitors annually and also because of its status as a tax haven
it is not a member of the european union but the euro is the de facto currency
the people of andorra have the 4th highest human life expectancy in the world — 82 years at birth
history tradition holds that charles the great charlemagne granted a charter to the andorran people in return for fighting against the moors
overlordship of the territory was by the count of urgell and eventually by the bishop of the diocese of urgell
in 988 borrell ii count of urgell gave the andorran valleys to the diocese of urgell in exchange for land in cerdanya
since then the bishop of urgell based in seu d urgell has owned andorra
before 1095 andorra did not have any type of military protection and the bishop of urgell who knew that the count of urgell wanted to reclaim the andorran valleys asked for help and protection from the lord of caboet
in 1095 the lord of caboet and the bishop of urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co sovereignty over andorra
arnalda daughter of arnau of caboet married the viscount of castellbò and both became viscounts of castellbò and cerdanya
years later their daughter ermessenda married roger bernat ii the french count of foix
they became roger bernat ii and ermessenda i counts of foix viscounts of castellbò and cerdanya and also co sovereigns of andorra shared with the bishop of urgell
in the 11th century a dispute arose between the bishop of urgell and the count of foix
the conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of aragon by the signing of the first paréage which provided that andorra s sovereignty be shared between the count of foix whose title would ultimately transfer to the french head of state and the bishop of urgell in catalonia
this gave the principality its territory and political form
over the years the co title to andorra passed to the kings of navarre
after henry of navarre became king henry iv of france he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the french state and the bishop of urgell as co princes of andorra
in 1812 – 13 the first french empire annexed catalonia and divided it in four département s with andorra being made part of the district of puigcerdà département of sègre
20th century andorra declared war on imperial germany during world war i but did not actually take part in the fighting
it remained in an official state of belligerency until 1958 as it was not included in the treaty of versailles
in 1933 france occupied andorra as a result of social unrest before elections
on july 12 1934 adventurer boris skossyreff issued a proclamation in urgell declaring himself boris i king of andorra simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of urgell
he was arrested by spanish authorities on july 20 and ultimately expelled from spain
from 1936 to 1940 a french detachment was garrisoned in andorra to prevent influences of the spanish civil war and francoist spain
francoist troops reached the andorran border in the later stages of the war
during world war ii andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between vichy france and spain
given its relative isolation andorra has existed outside the mainstream of european history with few ties to countries other than france and spain
in recent times however its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation
its political system was modernised in 1993 when it became a member of the united nations and the council of europe
politics andorra is a parliamentary co principality with the president of france and the bishop of urgell catalonia spain as co princes
this peculiarity makes the president of france in his capacity as prince of andorra an elected reigning monarch even though he is not elected by a popular vote of the andorran people
the politics of andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy whereby the prime minister of andorra is the head of government and of a multi party system
the current prime minister is antoni martí of the democrats for andorra da
executive power is exercised by the government
legislative power is vested in both government and parliament

the parliament of andorra is known as the general council
the general council consists of between 28 and 42 councillors as the members of the legislative branch are called
the councillors serve for four year terms and elections are held between the thirtieth and fortieth days following the dissolution of the previous council
the councillors can be elected on two equal constituencies
half are elected in equal number from each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the councillors are elected from a single national constituency
15 days after the election the councillors hold their inauguration
during this session the syndic general who is the head of the general council and the subsyndic general his assistant are elected
eight days later the council convenes once more
during this session the head of government the prime minister of andorra is chosen from among the councillors
candidates for the prime ministerial nomination can be proposed by a minimum of one fifth of the councillors
the council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be head of government
the syndic general then notifies the co princes who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the prime minister of andorra
the general council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws
bills may be presented to the council as private members bills by three of the local parish councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of andorra
the council also approves the annual budget of the principality
the government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires
if the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved
once any bill is approved the syndic general is responsible for presenting it to the co princes so that they may sign and enact it
if the head of government is not satisfied with the council he may request that the co princes dissolve the council and order new elections
in turn the councillors have the power to remove the head of government from office
after a motion of censure is approved by at least one fifth of the councillors the council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes the prime minister is removed
law and criminal justice the judiciary is composed of the magistrates court the criminal law court the high court of andorra and the constitutional court
the high court of justice is composed of five judges one appointed by the head of government one each by the coprinces one by the syndic general and one by the judges and magistrates
it is presided over by the member appointed by the syndic general and the judges hold office for six year terms
the magistrates and judges are appointed by the high court and so is the president of the criminal law court
the high court also appoints members of the office of the attorney general
the constitutional court is responsible for interpreting the constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties
it is composed of four judges one appointed by each of the coprinces and two by the general council
they serve eight year terms
the court is presided over by one of the judges on a two year rotation so that each judge at one point will be the leader of the court
foreign relations defence and security andorra does not have its own armed forces although there is a small ceremonial army
responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with france and spain
however in case of emergencies or natural disasters the sometent an alarm is called and all able bodied men between 21 and 60 of andorran nationality must serve
this is why all andorrans and especially the head of each house usually the eldest able bodied man of a house should by law keep a rifle even though the law also states that the police will offer a fire arm in case of need
andorra is a full member of the united nations un the organization for security and co operation in europe osce and has a special agreement with the european union eu
military andorra has a small army which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army
the basic principle of andorran defence is that all able bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the sometent
the duties of the andorran army are entirely ceremonial
in the modern era the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties
uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities
despite not being involved in any fighting andorra was technically the longest combatant in the first world war as the country was left out of the versailles peace conference and technically remained at war with germany from 1914 until 1939
the army s role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the police corps of andorra in 1931
brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the french police with a detachment resident in andorra for two months under the command of rené jules baulard
the andorran army was reformed in the following year with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles
the force consisted of six corporal s one for each parish although there are currently seven parishes there were only six until 1978 plus four junior staff officers to coordinate action and a commander with the rank of major
it was the responsibility of the six corporals each in his own parish to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able bodied men of the parish
today a small 12 man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the andorran army but all able bodied men remain technically available for military service with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm
the army has not fought for more than 700 years and its main responsibility is to present the andorran flag at official ceremonial functions
according to marc forné molné andorra s military budget is strictly from voluntary donations and the availability of full time voluntaries
the myth that all members of the andorran army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference
in reality all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers or non commissioned officer s because the other ranks are considered to be the rest of the able bodied male population who may still be called upon by the sometent to serve although such a call has not been made in modern times
gipa the grup d intervenció policia d andorra gipa is a small special forces unit trained in counter terrorism and hostage recovery tasks
although it is the closest in style to an active military force it is part of the police corps and not the army
as terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation the gipa is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties and at other times to routine policing
police corps andorra maintains a small but modern and well equipped internal police force with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants

in mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean pronounced arithmetic or simply the mean or average when the context is clear is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection
the collection is often a set of results of an experiment or a set of results from a survey
the term arithmetic mean is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other mean s such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean
in addition to mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics sociology and history and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent
for example per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nation s population
while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies it is not a robust statistic meaning that it is greatly influenced by outlier s values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values
notably for skewed distribution s such as the distribution of income for which a few people s incomes are substantially greater than most people s the arithmetic mean may not accord with one s notion of middle and robust statistics such as the median may be a better description of central tendency
definition suppose we have a data set containing the values a 1 ldots a n
the arithmetic mean a is defined via the expression if the data set is a statistical population i e consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them then the mean of that population is called the population mean
if the data set is a statistical sample a subset of the population we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean
the arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar for example as in bar read x bar which is the mean of the n values x1 x2 xn
motivating properties the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful especially as a measure of central tendency
these include contrast with median the arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median
the median is defined such that half the values are larger than and half are smaller than the median
if elements in the sample data increase arithmetically when placed in some order then the median and arithmetic average are equal
for example consider the data sample
the average is 2 5 as is the median
however when we consider a sample that can not be arranged so as to increase arithmetically such as the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly
in this case the arithmetic average is 6 2 and the median is 4
in general the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample and can be larger or smaller than most of them
there are applications of this phenomenon in many fields
for example since the 1980s in the united states median income has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income
generalizations weighted average a weighted average or weighted mean is an average in which some data points count more strongly than others in that they are given more weight in the calculation
for example the arithmetic mean of 3 and 5 is 3 5 2 4 or equivalently 1 2 × 3 1 2 × 5 4
in contrast a weighted mean in which the first number receives twice as much weight as the second perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled would be calculated as 2 3 × 3 1 3 × 5 11 3
here the weights which necessarily sum to the value one are 2 3 and 1 3 the former being twice the latter
note that the arithmetic mean sometimes called the unweighted average or equally weighted average can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other equal to 1 2 in the above example and equal to 1 n in a situation with n numbers being averaged
continuous probability distributions when a population of numbers and any sample of data from it could take on any of a continuous range of numbers instead of for example just integers then the probability of a number falling into one range of possible values could differ from the probability of falling into a different range of possible values even if the lengths of both ranges are the same
in such a case the set of probabilities can be described using a continuous probability distribution
the analog of a weighted average in this context in which there are an infinitude of possibilities for the precise value of the variable is called the mean of the probability distribution
the most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution it has the property that all measures of its central tendency including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode are equal to each other
this property does not hold however in the cases of a great many probability distributions such as the lognormal distribution illustrated here
angles particular care must be taken when using cyclic data such as phases or angle s naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1 ° and 359 ° yields a result of 180 °
this is incorrect for two reasons in general application such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range
a solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation viz
define the mean as the central point the point about which one has the lowest dispersion and redefine the difference as a modular distance i e the distance on the circle so the modular distance between 1 ° and 359 ° is 2 ° not 358 °

the american football conference afc is one of the two conferences of the national football league nfl
this conference and its counterpart the national football conference nfc currently contain 16 teams each making up the 32 teams of the nfl
the american football conference originated as the american football league afl with which the nfl combined in the afl – nfl merger of 1970
ten afc teams originally formed the afl while three others were nfl teams that were added to the afc to equalize the number of franchises and another three are more recent expansion teams one the houston texans plays in the market from which one of the afl s founding teams now known as the tennessee titans originated
current teams since 2002 the afc has 16 teams organized into four divisions each with four teams east north south and west
season structure each afc team plays the other teams in its division twice home and away during the regular season in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the nfl the previous may
two of these games are assigned on the basis of the team s final division standing in the previous season
the remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other nfl divisions
this assignment shifts each year
for instance in the 2007 regular season each team in the afc west played one game against each team in both the afc south and the nfc north
in this way division competition consists of common opponents with the exception of the 2 games assigned on the strength of each team s prior division standing
i e the division winner will face the other two division winners in the afc divisions that they are not scheduled to play the nfc operates according to the same system
at the end of each football season there are playoff games involving the top six teams in the afc the four division champions by place standing and the top two remaining non division champion teams wild cards by record
the last two teams remaining play in the afc championship game with the winner receiving the lamar hunt trophy
the afc champion plays the nfc champion in the super bowl
after super bowl xlvi the afc has won 19 super bowls to the 24 won by the nfc
since losing 13 consecutive super bowls in the 1980s and 1990s xix – xxxi the afc has won 9 of the last 15
the coach of the team with the best record that lost in the afc divisional round is the coach of the pro bowl
history the afc was created after the nfl merged with the american football league afl in 1970
all of the 10 former afl teams along with the nfl s cleveland browns pittsburgh steelers and the then baltimore colts joined the afc
the two afl divisions afl east and afl west were more or less intact
since the merger five expansion teams have joined the afc and two have left thus making the current total 16
when the seattle seahawks and the tampa bay buccaneers joined the league in 1976 they were temporarily placed in the nfc and afc respectively
this arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences
the seahawks eventually returned to the nfc as a result of the 2002 realignment
the expansion jacksonville jaguars joined the afc in 1995
due to the relocation controversy of the cleveland browns a new afc franchise called the baltimore ravens was officially established in 1996 while the browns were reactivated in 1999
the houston texans were then added to the league in 2002 joining the afc
between 2003 and 2012 the afc had sent either the indianapolis colts the new england patriots or the pittsburgh steelers to the super bowl with two exceptions
in the 2002 nfl season the oakland raiders lost to the tampa bay buccaneers in super bowl xxxvii and in the 2012 nfl season the baltimore ravens prevailed over new england in the conference championship to reach super bowl xlvii
by contrast the nfc sent a different team each year save for the 2011 nfl season when the new york giants made it to their second super bowl in that same time span super bowl xlvi
logo the merged league created a new logo for the afc that took elements of the old afl logo specifically the a and the six stars surrounding it
the afc logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009
the 2010 nfl season introduced an updated afc logo with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars leaving four representing the four divisions of the afc and moving the stars inside the letter similar to the nfc logo
animal farm is an allegorical novel by george orwell published in england on 17 august 1945
according to orwell the book reflects events leading up to the russian revolution of 1917 and then on into the stalin era in the soviet union
orwell a democratic socialist was a critic of joseph stalin and hostile to moscow directed stalinism especially after his experiences with the nkvd and the spanish civil war
the soviet union he believed had become a brutal dictatorship built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror
in a letter to yvonne davet orwell described animal farm as his novel contre stalin and in his essay why i write 1946 he wrote that animal farm was the first book in which he had tried with full consciousness of what he was doing to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole
the original title was animal farm a fairy story though the subtitle was dropped by u s publishers for its 1946 publication and subsequently all but one of the translations during orwell s lifetime omitted it
other variations in the title include a satire and a contemporary satire
orwell suggested the title union des républiques socialistes animales for the french translation which recalled the french name of the soviet union union des républiques socialistes soviétiques and which abbreviates to ursa the latin for bear a symbol of russia
orwell wrote the book from november 1943 – february 1944 when the wartime alliance with the soviet union was at its height and stalin was held in high esteem in britain among the people and intelligentsia a fact that orwell hated
it was initially rejected by a number of british and american publishers including one of orwell s own victor gollancz
its publication was thus delayed though it became a great commercial success when it did finally appear partly because the cold war so quickly followed world war ii
time magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best english language novels 1923 to 2005 it also featured at number 31 on the modern library list of best 20th century novels
it won a retrospective hugo award in 1996 and is also included in the great books of the western world selection
the novel addresses not only the corruption of the revolution by its leaders but also the ways wickedness indifference ignorance greed and myopia corrupt the revolution
it portrays corrupt leadership as the flaw in revolution rather than the act of revolution itself
it also shows how potential ignorance and indifference to problems within a revolution could allow horrors to happen if a smooth transition to a people s government is not achieved
plot summary old major the old boar on the manor farm calls the animals on the farm together for a meeting during which he compares the humans to parasite s and teaches the animals a revolutionary song beasts of england
when major dies two young pigs snowball and napoleon assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the rebellion
the animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible mr jones from the farm renaming it animal farm
they adopt seven commandments of animalism the most important of which is all animals are equal
snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing food is plentiful and the farm runs smoothly
the pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items ostensibly for their personal health
napoleon takes the pups from the farm dogs and trains them privately
napoleon and snowball struggle for leadership
when snowball announces his plans to build a windmill napoleon has his dogs chase snowball away and declares himself leader
napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm
through a young pig named squealer napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea
the animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill
when the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm napoleon and squealer convince the animals that snowball destroyed it
once snowball becomes a scapegoat napoleon begins purging the farm with his dogs killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival
beasts of england is replaced by an anthem glorifying napoleon who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man
the animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were when under mr jones
mr frederick one of the neighbouring farmers attacks the farm using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill
though the animals win the battle they do so at great cost as many including boxer the workhorse are wounded
despite his injuries boxer continues working harder and harder until he collapses while working on the windmill
napoleon sends for a van to take boxer to the veterinary surgeon explaining that better care can be given there
benjamin the cynical donkey who could read as well as any pig notices that the van belongs to a knacker and attempts a futile rescue
squealer reports that the van was purchased by the hospital and the writing from the previous owner had not been repainted
he recounts a tale of boxer s death in the hands of the best medical care
years pass and the pigs learn to walk upright carry whips and wear clothes
the seven commandments are reduced to a single phrase all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers with whom he celebrates a new alliance
he abolishes practice of the revolutionary traditions and renames the farm the manor farm
the animals overhearing the conversation notice that the faces of the pigs have begun changing
during a poker match an argument breaks out between napoleon and mr pilkington and the animals realise that the faces of the pigs look like the faces of humans and no one can tell the difference between them
characters pigs humans equines other animals composition and publication origin george orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 subsequent to his experiences during the spanish civil war which he described in homage to catalonia 1938
in the preface of a 1947 ukrainian edition of animal farm he explained how escaping the communist purges in spain taught him how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries
this motivated orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals
immediately prior to his writing orwell had quit the bbc
he was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the ministry of information had put out
the booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the soviet union such as directions to claim that the red terror was a figment of nazi imagination
in the preface orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm efforts to find a publisher orwell encountered great difficulty getting the manuscript published as it was feared that the book might upset the alliance between the us uk and the soviet union
four publishers refused one had initially accepted the work but declined after consulting the ministry of information
eventually secker and warburg published the first edition in 1945
during world war ii it became apparent to orwell that anti soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch — including his regular publisher gollancz
he also submitted the manuscript to faber and faber where the poet t s eliot who was a director of the firm rejected it eliot wrote back to orwell praising its good writing and fundamental integrity but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint which i take to be generally trotskyite
eliot said he found the view not convincing and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm he posited that someone might argue what was needed
was not more communism but more public spirited pigs
orwell let andré deutsch who was working for nicholson watson in 1944 read the typescript and deutsch was convinced that nicholson watson would want to publish it however they did not and lectured orwell on what they perceived to be errors in animal farm
in his london letter on 17 april 1944 for partisan review orwell wrote that it was now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti russian printed
anti russian books do appear but mostly from catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle
the publisher jonathan cape who had initially accepted animal farm subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him off — although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a soviet spy
writing to leonard moore a partner in the literary agency of christy moore publisher jonathan cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the ministry of information
such flagrant anti soviet bias was unacceptable and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive
it may reasonably be assumed that the important official was a man named peter smollett who was later unmasked as a soviet agent
orwell was suspicious of smollett smolka and he would be one of the names orwell included in his list of crypto communists and fellow travellers sent to the information research department in 1949
born hans peter smolka in vienna in 1912 he came to britain in 1933 as an nkvd agent with the codename abo became a naturalized british subject in 1938 changed his name and after the outbreak of world war ii joined the ministry of information where he organised pro soviet propaganda working with kim philby in 1943 45
smollett s family have rejected the accusation that he was a spy
the publisher wrote to orwell saying frederic warburg also faced pressures against publication even from people in his own office and from his wife pamela who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards stalin and the heroic red army which had played a major part in defeating hitler
a russian translation was printed in the paper posev and in giving permission for a russian translation of animal farm orwell refused in advance all royalties
a translation in ukrainian which was produced in germany was confiscated in large part by the american wartime authorities and handed over to the soviet repatriation commission
in october 1945 orwell wrote to fredric warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist david low would illustrate animal farm
low had written a letter saying that he had had a good time with animal farm an excellent bit of satire it would illustrate perfectly
nothing came of this but an edition illustrated by the cartoonist ralph steadman was published by secker warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of animal farm in 1945
the freedom of the press orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about british self censorship and how the british people were suppressing criticism of the ussr their world war ii ally
the sinister fact about literary censorship in england is that it is largely voluntary things are kept right out of the british press not because the government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that it would n t do to mention that particular fact
although the first edition allowed space for the preface it was not included and as of june 2009 it has not been published with most editions of the book
secker and warburg published the first edition of animal farm in 1945 without any introduction
however the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author s proof composited from the manuscript
for reasons unknown no preface was supplied and all the page numbers needed to be redone at the last minute
years later in 1972 ian angus found the original typescript titled the freedom of the press and bernard crick published it together with his own introduction in the times literary supplement on 15 september 1972 as how the essay came to be written
orwell s essay criticised british self censorship by the press specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of stalin and the soviet government
the same essay also appeared in the italian 1976 animal farm edition with another introduction by crick claiming to be the first edition with the preface
other publishers were still declining to publish it
critical response contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive
writing in the american new republic magazine george soule expressed his disappointment in the book writing that it puzzled and saddened me
it seemed on the whole dull
the allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly
soule argued that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations and said it seems to me that the failure of this book commercially it is already assured of tremendous success arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well
tosco fyvel writing in tribune 24 august 1945 called the book a gentle satire on a certain state and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us
julian symons responded on 7 september should we not expect in tribune at least acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular state soviet russia
it seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify napoleon with stalin and snowball with trotsky and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author upon a political ground
in a hundred years time perhaps animal farm may be simply a fairy story today it is a political satire with a good deal of point
animal farm has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks
analysis animalism the pigs snowball napoleon and squealer adapt old major s ideas into a complete system of thought which they formally name animalism
soon after napoleon and squealer indulge in the vices of humans drinking alcohol sleeping in beds trading
squealer is employed to alter the seven commandments to account for this humanisation an allusion to the soviet government s revising of history in order to exercise control of the people s beliefs about themselves and their society
the original commandments are later napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law breaking
the changed commandments are as follows with the changes bolded eventually these are replaced with the maxims all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others and four legs good two legs better
as the pigs become more human
this is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans evil habits
through the revision of the commandments orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda
significance and allegory in the eastern bloc both animal farm and later nineteen eighty four were on the list of forbidden books until the end of communism in 1989 and were only available via clandestine samizdat networks
orwell biographer jeffrey meyers has written virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory
orwell himself wrote in 1946 of course i intended it primarily as a satire on the russian revolution
and that kind of revolution violent conspiratorial revolution led by unconsciously power hungry people can only lead to a change of masters revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert
in a preface for a 1947 ukrainian edition he stated for the past ten years i have been convinced that the destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement
on my return from spain in 1937 i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages
the revolt of the animals against farmer jones is orwell s analogy with the october 1917 bolshevik revolution and jones s attempt to regain control with the aid of neighbouring farmers parallels the western powers efforts 1918 21 to crush the bolsheviks
the pigs rise to pre eminence mirrors the rise of a stalinist bureaucracy in the ussr just as napoleon s emergence as the farm s sole leader reflects stalin s emergence
the pigs appropriation of milk and apples for their own use the turning point of the story as orwell termed it in a letter to dwight macdonald stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left wing 1921 kronstadt revolt against the bolsheviks and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various five year plans
the puppies controlled by napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the stalinist structure and the pigs treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s
in chapter seven when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed orwell directly alludes to the purges confessions and show trials of the late 1930s
these contributed to orwell s conviction that the bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the soviet system become rotten
peter edgerly firchow and peter hobley davison consider that in real life with events in animal farm mirroring those in the soviet union the battle of the windmill represents the great patriotic war world war ii especially the battle of stalingrad and the battle of moscow
during the battle fredrick drills a hole and places explosive s inside and then all the animals including napoleon took cover orwell had the publisher alter this to all the animals except napoleon in recognition of joseph stalin s decision to remain in moscow during the german advance
this very particular alteration had been occasioned by orwell having been in paris in march 1945 working as a war correspondent for the observer and the manchester evening news
in paris he met joseph czapski a survivor of the katyn massacre
in spite of czapski s opposition to the soviet regime he told orwell as orwell wrote to arthur koestler that it had been the character and greatness of stalin that saved russia from the german invasion
the battle of the cowshed represents the allied invasion of the soviet russia in 1918 and the defeat of the white russians in the russian civil war
other connections that writers have suggested illustrate orwell s telescoping of russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion which stands for the abortive revolutions in hungary and germany ch iv the conflict between napoleon and snowball chv paralleling the two rival and quasi messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another trotskyism with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the west and stalinism with its glorification of russia s socialist destiny napoleon s dealings with whymper and the willingdon markets ch vi paralleling the treaty of rapallo and frederick s bank notes paralleling the hitler stalin non aggression pact of august 1939 which are forgeries
frederick attacks animal farm without warning and destroys the windmill
the book s close with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement reflected orwell s view of the 1943 teheran conference that seemed to display the establishment of the best possible relations between the ussr and the west — but in reality were destined as orwell presciently predicted to continue to unravel
the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pilkington both suspicious played an ace of spades simultaneously
cultural references references to the novella are frequent in other works of popular culture particularly in popular music and television series
adaptations a bbc radio version produced by rayner heppenstall was broadcast in january 1947
orwell listened to the production at his home in canonbury square in london with hugh gordon porteous amongst others
orwell later wrote to heppenstall that porteous who had not read the book grasped what was happening after a few minutes
a further radio production again using orwell s own dramatisation of the book was broadcast in january 2013 on bbc radio four
tamsin greig narrated and the cast included nicky henson as napoleon toby jones as the propagandist squealer and ralph ineson as boxer
animal farm has been adapted to film twice with a third version to potentially follow in 2012
the 1954 animal farm film was an animated feature and the 1999 animal farm film was a tv live action version
both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties including sanitising some aspects
in the 1954 version napoleon is apparently overthrown in a second revolution
the 1999 film shows napoleon s regime collapsing in on itself with the farm having new human owners as happened in the soviet union appropriating the new political reality to the story
in 2012 a hfr 3d version of animal farm potentially directed by andy serkis was announced
a theatrical version with music by richard peaslee and lyrics by adrian mitchell was staged at the national theatre london on 25 april 1984 directed by peter hall
it toured nine cities in 1985
a solo version adapted and performed by guy masterson premièred at the traverse theatre edinburgh in january 1995 and has toured worldwide since
editions on 17 july 2009 amazon com withdrew certain amazon kindle titles including animal farm and nineteen eighty four by george orwell from sale refunded buyers and remotely deleted items from purchasers devices after discovering that the publisher lacked rights to publish the titles in question
notes and annotations for the books made by users on their devices were also deleted
after the move prompted outcry and comparisons to nineteen eighty four itself amazon spokesman drew herdener stated that the company is c hanging our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers devices in these circumstances

amphibians are ectotherm ic tetrapod vertebrate s of the class amphibia
they inhabit a wide variety of habitats with most species living within terrestrial fossorial arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems
amphibians typically start out as larva living in water but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this
the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air breathing form with lungs
amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamander s and frog s lack lungs and rely entirely upon skin
they are superficially similar to reptile s but along with mammals and birds reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed
with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often ecological indicator s and in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe
the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony limbed fins features that were helpful in adapting to dry land
they diversified and became dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates
over time amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity leaving only the modern subclass lissamphibia
the three modern orders of amphibians are anura the frogs and toads caudata urodela the salamanders and gymnophiona apoda the caecilian s
the total number of known amphibian species is approximately 7 000 of which nearly 90 are frogs
the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis with a length of just
the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is dwarfed by the extinct prionosuchus from the middle permian of brazil
the study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology
evolution the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period around 370 million years ago from lobe finned fish similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish which had evolved multi jointed leg like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom
some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen
they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required
eventually their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapod s including modern amphibians reptile s bird s and mammal s despite being able to crawl on land many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water
they had started to develop lungs but still breathed predominantly with gills
ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians with nostrils and more efficient lungs
it had four sturdy limbs a neck a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe finned fish eusthenopteron
amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods
their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger better able to cope with the increased gravitational effect of life on land
they developed hands and feet with five or more digits the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation
the fish s hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land
an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra occipital bones at the back of the head neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom
at the end of the devonian period 360 million years ago the seas rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates though some such as ichthyostega may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water
it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal
in the early carboniferous 360 to 345 million years ago the climate became wet and warm
extensive swamps developed with moss es fern s horsetail s and calamites
air breathing arthropod s evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment
there were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile
though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air most still had a long tapering body and strong tail
they were the top land predators sometimes reaching several metres in length preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water
they still needed to return to water to lay their shell less eggs and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors
it was the development of the amniotic egg which prevents the developing embryo from drying out that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed
during the triassic period 250 to 200 million years ago the reptiles began to out compete the amphibians leading to a reduction in both the amphibians size and their importance in the biosphere
according to the fossil record lissamphibia which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic
the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating but the most recent molecular study based on multilocus sequence typing suggests a late carboniferous early permian origin of extant amphibians
the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate
a 2005 molecular phylogeny based on rdna analysis suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs
it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic around 250 million years ago before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe finned fish
the briefness of this period and the swiftness with which radiation took place would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils
there are large gaps in the fossil record but the discovery of a proto frog from the early permian in texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs
molecular analysis suggests that the frog – salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates
as they evolved from lunged fish amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion
in the water the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land quite different mechanisms were required
their vertebral columns limbs limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding
terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of air
they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature
they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment
their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water
the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss
classification the word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term ἀμφίβιος amphíbios which means both kinds of life ἀμφί meaning of both kinds and βιος meaning life
the term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water including seals and otters
traditionally the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes
amphibia in its widest sense sensu lato was divided into three subclasses two of which are extinct the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed
the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb university of california berkeley and the classification by herpetologist darrel frost and the american museum of natural history available as the online reference database amphibian species of the world
the numbers of species cited above follow frost and the total number of known amphibian species is approximately 7 000 of which nearly 90 are frogs
with the phylogenetic classification the taxon labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a paraphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics
classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem based or a node based classification
traditionally amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians and all their descendants is called lissamphibia
the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups like the temnospondyli traditionally placed in the subclass labyrinthodontia or the lepospondyli and in some analyses even in the amniotes
this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal devonian and carboniferous amphibian type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy
if the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia it becomes a paraphyletic group
all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia which is usually considered a clade a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor
the three modern orders are anura the frogs and toads caudata or urodela the salamanders and gymnophiona or apoda the caecilians
it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a temnospondyl like ancestor and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians and thus of amniotes
although the fossils of several older proto frogs with primitive characteristics are known the oldest true frog is prosalirus bitis from the early jurassic kayenta formation of arizona
it is anatomically very similar to modern frogs
the oldest known caecilian is another early jurassic species eocaecilia micropodia and is also from arizona
the earliest salamander is beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the late jurassic of northeastern china
authorities disagree as to whether salientia is a superorder that includes the order anura or whether anura is a sub order of the order salientia
the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders but an extinct salamander like family the albanerpetontidae is now considered part of the lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia
furthermore salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic proto frog triadobatrachus
characteristics the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs
reptiles birds and mammals are amniotes the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes some of which are impervious
lacking these membranes amphibians require water bodies for reproduction although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage
they are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps
on land amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp
the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a microhylid frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis first discovered in 2012
it has an average length of and is part of a genus which contains four of the world s ten smallest frog species
the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed — the extinct prionosuchus a crocodile like temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle permian of brazil
the largest frog is the african goliath frog conraua goliath which can reach and weigh
amphibians are ectothermic cold blooded vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes
their metabolic rate is low and as a result their food and energy requirements are limited
in the adult state they have tear ducts and movable eyelids and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations
they have muscular tongues which in many species can be protruded
modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes
their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae
their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified
their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales apart from a few fish like scales in certain caecilians
the skin contains many mucous gland s and in some species poison glands
the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle
they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea
most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults
amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils
these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat
they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin
anura the order anura from the latin an meaning without and the ancient greek oura meaning tail comprises the frogs and toads
they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them shorter forelimbs webbed toes with no claws no tails large eyes and glandular moist skin
members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs while those with skins are known as toads
the difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule
members of the family bufonidae are known as the true toads
frogs range in size from the goliath frog conraua goliath of west africa to the paedophryne amauensis first described in papua new guinea in 2012 which is also the smallest known vertebrate
although most species are associated with water and damp habitats some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts
they are found worldwide except for polar areas
anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community but the relationships between some families remain unclear
future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships
the suborder archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs
these are ascaphidae bombinatoridae discoglossidae and leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages
the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia consist of the fossorial megophryidae pelobatidae pelodytidae scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae
these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders
neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs including most common species
96 of the over 5 000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians
caudata the order caudata from the latin cauda meaning tail consists of the salamanders — elongated low slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form
this is a symplesiomorphic trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals
salamanders lack claws have scale free skins either smooth or covered with tubercle s and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned
they range in size from the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus which has been reported to grow to a length of to the diminutive thorius pennatulus from mexico which seldom exceeds in length
salamanders are distributed widely in the holarctic region of the northern hemisphere
the family plethodontidae is also found in central america and south america north of the amazon basin
urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders
members of several families of salamanders have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults
most salamanders are under long
they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat
when on land they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms insects and other invertebrates
the suborder cryptobranchoidea contains the primitive salamanders
a number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found but there are only three living species the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus the japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus and the hellbender cryptobranchus alleganiensis from north america
these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded
a unique feature is their ability to feed by suction depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right
the males excavate nests persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them and guard them
as well as breathing with lungs they respire through the many folds in their thin skin which has capillaries close to the surface
the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders
they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw and by using internal fertilisation
in salamandrids the male deposits a bundle of sperm the spermatophore and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid
the largest family in this group is plethodontidae the lungless salamanders which includes 60 of all salamander species
the family salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name newt is given to members of its subfamily pleurodelinae
the third suborder sirenoidea contains the four species of sirens which are in a single family sirenidae
members of this order are eel like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs
some of their features are primitive while others are derived
fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermatheca e for sperm storage
despite this the eggs are laid singly a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation
gymnophiona the order gymnophiona from the greek gymnos meaning naked and ophis meaning serpent or apoda from the latin an meaning without and the greek poda meaning legs comprise the caecilians
these are long cylindrical limbless animals with a snake or worm like form
the adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres 3 to 30 inches with the exception of thomson s caecilian caecilia thompsoni which can reach 150 centimetres 5 feet
a caecilian s skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales
it has rudimentary eyes covered in skin which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity
it also has a pair of short tentacle s near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions
most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil in rotten wood and under plant debris but some are aquatic
most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch they make their way to adjacent bodies of water
others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch
a few species give birth to live young nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct
caecilians are found in tropical africa asia and central and south america
anatomy and physiology skin the integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands
local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads
the outside of the skin is shed periodically more or less in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes
amphibians often eat the sloughed skin
caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin
the similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial
lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderm s forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages
amphibian skin is permeable to water
gas exchange can take place through the skin and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds
to compensate for their thin and delicate skin amphibians have evolved mucous glands principally on their heads backs and tails
the secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist
in addition most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances
some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect
the main poison producing glands the paratoids produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads along the backs of frogs behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians
the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophore s these three cell layers consist of the melanophores occupying the deepest layer the guanophores forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules producing a blue green colour and the lipophores yellow the most superficial layer
the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormone s secreted by the pituitary gland
unlike bony fish there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish
a vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators
skeletal system and locomotion amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods though with a number of variations
they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs
the bones are hollow and lightweight
the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body
the bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes
the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle and the well developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs
the ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals
in most amphibians there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot but no claws on either
some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiuma s are eel like in appearance with tiny stubby legs
the sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs
the caecilians are limbless
they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body
on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side
in frogs the hind legs are larger than the fore legs especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming
in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies
the feet have adaptations for the way of life with webbing between the toes for swimming broad adhesive toe pads for climbing and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging frogs usually dig backwards into the soil
in most salamanders the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body
locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop particularly when climbing
in their normal gait only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors the lobe finned fish
some salamanders in the genus aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs large toepads and prehensile tails
in aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion
adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones
salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as autotomy
certain species in the plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily
the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape
both tails and limbs can be regenerated
adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so
circulatory system amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct
in the juvenile or tadpole stage the circulation is similar to that of a fish the two chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated around the body and back to the heart in a single loop
in the adult stage amphibians especially frogs lose their gills and develop lungs
they have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria
when the ventricle starts contracting deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs
continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body
mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers
nervous and sensory systems the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates with a central brain a spinal cord and nerves throughout the body
the amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish
it consists of equal parts cerebrum midbrain and cerebellum
various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning
the cerebellum is the centre of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration
the brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body
the pineal body known to regulate sleep patterns in humans is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians
tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians
some caecilians possess electroreceptors that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water
the ears are well developed in frogs
there is no external ear but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye
this vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone the stapes to the inner ear
only high frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way but low frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism
there is a patch of specialized haircells called papilla amphibiorum in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds
another feature unique to frogs and salamanders is the columella operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals
the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound
the eyes of tadpoles lack lids but at metamorphosis the cornea becomes more dome shaped the lens becomes flatter and eyelid s and associated glands and ducts develop
the adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes
they allow colour vision and depth of focus
in the retinas are green rods which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths
digestive and excretory systems many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws
some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia
most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs
the short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage
the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitin ous cuticle of arthropod prey
amphibians possess a pancreas liver and gall bladder
the liver is usually large with two lobes
its size is determined by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up
adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen under the skin and in some salamanders in the tail
there are two kidney s located dorsally near the roof of the body cavity
their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent
larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine while terrestrial species with a greater need to conserve water excrete the less toxic product urea
some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid
respiratory system the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes possessing few internal septa and large alveoli and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood
ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping
most amphibians however are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin
to enable sufficient cutaneous respiration the surface of their highly vascularized skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate
because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration as in the titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander
in air where oxygen is more concentrated some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange most famously the plethodontid salamanders which have neither lungs nor gills
many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage with some such as the axolotl retaining gills as aquatic adults
reproduction for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist
a few e g fejervarya raja can inhabit brackish water but there are no true marine amphibians
there are reports however of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters
such was the case with the black sea invasion of the natural hybrid pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010
several hundred frog species in adaptive radiation s e g eleutherodactylus the pacific platymantines the australo papuan microhylids and many other tropical frogs however do not need any water for breeding in the wild
they reproduce via direct development an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free standing water
almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult passing through the tadpole stage within the egg
reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall but the seasonal timing
in the tropics many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year
in temperate regions breeding is mostly seasonal usually in the spring and is triggered by increasing day length rising temperatures or rainfall
experiments have shown the importance of temperature but the trigger event especially in arid regions is often a storm
in anurans males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active
in caecilians fertilisation is internal the male extruding an intromittent organ the phallodeum and inserting it into the female cloaca
the paired müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm
fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct
the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation
in most of these the male deposits a spermatophore a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone on the substrate either on land or in the water
the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent
the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later
courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species
in some the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus
certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae hynobiidae and cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass
with a few exceptions frogs use external fertilisation
the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs or in the case of epipedobates tricolor around the neck
they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm
roughened nuptial pads on the male s hands aid in retaining grip
often the male collects and retains the egg mass forming a sort of basket with the hind feet
an exception is the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously
the tailed frog ascaphus truei exhibits internal fertilisation
the tail is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female
this frog lives in fast flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs
the sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring
most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders
typically prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site the males usually arriving first calling and setting up territories
other satellite males remain quietly nearby waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory
the females arrive sporadically mate selection takes place and eggs are laid
the females depart and territories may change hands
more females appear and in due course the breeding season comes to an end
explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall
these frogs are typically species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site
they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season
the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females
life cycle most amphibians go through metamorphosis a process of significant morphological change after birth
in typical amphibian development eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle
frogs toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills
metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood which stimulates metamorphosis and prolactin which counteracts thyroxine s effect
specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues
because most embryonic development is outside the parental body it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances
for this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth whisker like skin extensions or fins
they also make use of a sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish
after metamorphosis these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death called apoptosis
the variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide with many discoveries still being made
eggs the egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoprotein s and mucopolysaccharide s this capsule is permeable to water and gases and swells considerably as it absorbs water
the ovum is at first rigidly held but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the embryo to move freely
this also happens in salamander eggs even when they are unfertilised
eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae
these penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis
they seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality
most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation
caecilians some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs that lay eggs underground have unpigmented eggs
in the wood frog rana sylvatica the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to 6 ° c 11 ° f warmer than its surroundings which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat
the eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups or may take the form of spherical egg masses rafts or long strings
in terrestrial caecilians the eggs are laid in grape like clusters in burrows near streams
the amphibious salamander ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots
the greenhouse frog eleutherodactylus planirostris lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage
the tungara frog physalaemus pustulosus builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs
first a raft is built then eggs are laid in the centre and finally a foam cap is overlaid
the foam has anti microbial properties
it contains no detergent s but is created by whipping up protein s and lectin s secreted by the female
larvae the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults
in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders plethodontidae direct development takes place the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults
many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies
some caecilians the alpine salamander salamandra atra and some of the african live bearing toads nectophrynoides spp
are viviparous
their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female s oviduct often for long periods
other amphibians but not caecilians are ovoviviparous
the eggs are retained in or on the parent s body but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult
the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth either before or after metamorphosis according to their species
the toad genus nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members
frogsfrog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long vertically flattened tails with fins
the free living larvae are normally fully aquatic but the tadpoles of some species such as nannophrys ceylonensis are semi terrestrial and live among wet rocks
tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons gills for respiration external gills at first internal gills later lateral line system s and large tails that they use for swimming
newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills
the lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air
some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs
these larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place
while tadpoles do not have true teeth in most species the jaws have long parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak
front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later
tadpoles are typically herbivorous feeding mostly on alga e including diatom s filtered from the water through the gill s they are also detritivore s stirring up the sediment at the pond bottom and ingesting edible fragments
they have a relatively long spiral shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet
some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage eating insects smaller tadpoles and fish
young of the cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis can occasionally be cannibalistic the younger tadpoles attacking a larger more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis
at metamorphosis rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely
the spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut
the animal develops a large jaw and its gills disappear along with its gill sac
eyes and legs grow quickly and a tongue is formed
there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system
all this can happen in about a day
a few days later the tail is reabsorbed due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place
salamanders at hatching a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids teeth in both upper and lower jaws three pairs of feathery external gills a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins
the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water
pond type larvae often have a pair of balancers rod like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment
some members of the genera ambystoma and dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form but this varies with species and with populations
the northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile is one of these and depending on environmental factors either remains permanently in the larval state a condition known as neoteny or transforms into an adult
both of these are able to breed
neoteny occurs when the animal s growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine
other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food lack of trace elements and competition from conspecific s the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process
the adult tiger salamander is terrestrial but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state
when conditions are particularly inhospitable on land larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out
there are fifteen species of neotenic salamanders including species of necturus proteus and amphiuma and many examples of ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances
lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter
each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander
the female salamander often broods the eggs
in the genus ensatinas the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion
in newts and salamanders metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs
this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems
their lungs are functional early but the larvae do n t make as much use of them as do tadpoles
their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water
other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins the closure of gill slits thickening of the skin the development of eyelids and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure
salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land
adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer and a land phase in winter
for adaptation to a water phase prolactin is the required hormone and for adaptation to the land phase thyroxine
external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time
caecilians most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water
the development of the young of ichthyophis glutinosus a species from sri lanka has been much studied
the eel like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water
they have three pairs of external red feathery gills a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes a lateral line system and a short tail with fins
they swim by undulating their body from side to side
they are mostly active at night soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land
metamorphosis is gradual
by the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes lateral line systems and tails
the skin thickens embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments
by this time the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land
in the majority of species of caecilians the young are produced by vivipary
typhlonectes compressicauda a species from south america is typical of these
up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time
they are elongated and have paired sac like gills small eyes and specialised scraping teeth
at first they feed on the yolks of the eggs but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct
this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipid s and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall
they may increase their length sixfold and be two fifths as long as their mother before being born
by this time they have undergone metamorphosis lost their eyes and gills developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles and reabsorbed their teeth
a permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth
the ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction
the progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy
the brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate
meanwhile they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca
parental care the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but in general the larger the number of eggs in a batch the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place
nevertheless it is estimated that in up to 20 of amphibian species one or both adults play some role in the care of the young
those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young
many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land
the black mountain salamander desmognathus welteri does this the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs
when fully developed they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders
the male hellbender a primitive salamander excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there
the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen
the male colostethus subpunctatus a tiny frog protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log
when the eggs hatch the male transports the tadpoles on his back stuck there by a mucous secretion to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off
the male midwife toad alytes obstetricans winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks
he keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles
the female gastric brooding frog rheobatrachus spp
reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings however this stage was never observed before the species became extinct
the tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply
the pouched frog assa darlingtoni lays eggs on the ground
when they hatch the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs
the aquatic surinam toad pipa pipa raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis
the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family dendrobatidae
its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water filled crevice such as the of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad
the female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles
feeding and diet with a few exceptions adult amphibians are predators feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow
the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles caterpillars earthworms and spiders
the sirens siren spp
often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a brazilian tree frog xenohyla truncata includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet
the mexican burrowing toad rhinophrynus dorsalis has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites
it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first their tongues being hinged at the front
food is mostly selected by sight even in conditions of dim light
movement of the prey triggers a feeding response
frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs rana clamitans have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past
toads salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey
this response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves
cave dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell
some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell even in complete darkness
amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it
they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth a feature unique to amphibians
the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals
salamanders caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs rana spp
lack teeth in the lower jaw and toads bufo spp
have no teeth
in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth
the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates
others amphibians such as the bufo spp
toads actively search for prey while the argentine horned frog ceratophrys ornata lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes
among leaf litter frogs in panama frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim often brightly coloured and toxic while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well camouflaged
caecilians do not flick their tongues but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward pointing teeth
the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow
the subdued prey is gulped down whole
when they are newly hatched frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg
when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria algal crusts detritus and raspings from submerged plants
water is drawn in through their mouths which are usually at the bottom of their heads and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out
others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth
they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths
some such as the spadefoot toads have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic
vocalization the calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks grunts or hisses and have not been much studied
a clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation as in bats or a form of communication
most salamanders are considered voiceless but the california giant salamander dicamptodon ensatus has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound
some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked
frogs are much more vocal especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates
the presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself
in most species the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth
this may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere or the water at times when the animal is submerged
the main vocalisation is the male s loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory
this call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near
calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy
other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus
when a frog is attacked a distress or fright call is emitted often resembling a scream
the usually nocturnal cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours
territorial behaviour little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges
these are usually feeding breeding or sheltering sites
males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species females and even juveniles are also involved
although in many frog species females are larger than males this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence
some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest arms or thumbs
in salamanders defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder
this may involve snapping chasing and sometimes biting occasionally causing the loss of a tail
the behaviour of red backed salamander s plethodon cinereus has been much studied
91 of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre yard of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock
a similar proportion when moved experimentally a distance of found their way back to their home base
the salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair
these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas
much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals
an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively
if the intruder persisted a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso labial grooves
damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food
in frogs male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates
in general a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males
much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires
there is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders
holders of territories have a home advantage and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar sized frogs
if threats are insufficient chest to chest tussles may take place
fighting methods include pushing and shoving deflating the opponent s vocal sac seizing him by the head jumping on his back biting chasing splashing and ducking him under the water
defence mechanisms amphibians have soft bodies and thin skins lack claws defensive armour or spines and seem relatively helpless
nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive
the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce
this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip
the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic
snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow african clawed frog s xenopus laevis which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape
caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the cayenne caecilian typhlonectes compressicauda produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in brazil
in some salamanders the skin is poisonous
the rough skinned newt taricha granulosa from north america and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ttx the most toxic non protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish
handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly
in feeding trials fish frogs reptiles birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible
the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis
in locations where both snake and salamander co exist the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity
coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity
some frogs and toads are toxic the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back
these regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms
altogether over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated
poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity
these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black with the fire salamander salamandra salamandra being an example
once a predator has sampled one of these it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal
in some species such as the fire bellied toad bombina spp
the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked exhibiting their bright colours to the predator
the frog allobates zaparo is not poisonous but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality a strategy that may deceive predators
many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight
other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected
they have various colourings such as mottled browns greys and olives to blend into the background
some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the north american northern short tailed shrew blarina brevicauda
their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison producing granular glands
a few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape
the tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached
the tail is regenerated later but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant
some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce and some spadefoot toads pelobates spp scream and leap towards the attacker
giant salamanders of the genus andrias as well as ceratophrine and pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite
the blackbelly salamander desmognathus quadramaculatus can bite an attacking common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape
conservation dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity
in 2006 there were believed to be 4 035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle
of these 1 356 33 6 were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1 427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status
a number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification over exploitation pollution introduced species climate change endocrine disrupting pollutants destruction of the ozone layer ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin eyes and eggs of amphibians and diseases like chytridiomycosis
however many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and are a topic of ongoing discussion
with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often considered to be ecological indicator s in many terrestrial ecosystems they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass
any decline in amphibian numbers will have an impact on the patterns of predation
the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species
in the middle east a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquito es
predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline
the western terrestrial garter snake thamnophis elegans in california is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are diminishing in numbers the yosemite toad bufo canorus and the mountain yellow legged frog rana muscosa putting the snake s future at risk
if the snake were to become scarce this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it
meanwhile in the ponds and lakes fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles
these normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom
a reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose
aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences
a global strategy to stem the crisis was released in 2005 in the form of the amphibian conservation action plan
developed by over eighty leading experts in the field this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost
the amphibian specialist group of the world conservation union iucn is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation
amphibian ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex situ conservation recommendations of this plan and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians
one such project is the panama amphibian rescue and conservation project that built on existing conservation efforts in panama to create a country wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis
study the study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology
these are part of the broader discipline of zoology but are seldom studied alone
research in these fields may explore the animals taxonomy morphology behaviour ecology physiology or biochemistry
the results of the research are peer reviewed and published in scientific journals
career opportunities include field research university teaching and research curating museum research or management zoo keeping breeding or selling animals and wildlife management

alaska is a state in the united states situated in the northwest extremity of the north american continent with the international boundary with canada to the east the arctic ocean to the north and the pacific ocean to the west and south with russia further west across the bering strait
alaska is the largest state in the united states by area the 4th least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 united states
approximately half of alaska s 731 449 residents live within the anchorage metropolitan area
alaska s economy is dominated by the oil natural gas and fishing industries it has these resources in abundance
alaska was purchased from russia on march 30 1867 for 7 2 million adjusted for inflation at approximately two cents per acre 4 74 km ²
the land went through several administrative changes before becoming an organized or incorporated territory on may 11 1912 and the 49th state of the u s on january 3 1959
the name alaska аляска was already introduced in the russian colonial period when it was used only for the peninsula and is derived from the aleut alaxsxaq meaning the mainland or more literally the object towards which the action of the sea is directed
it is also known as alyeska the great land an aleut word derived from the same root
geography alaska has a longer coastline than all the other u s states combined
it is the only non contiguous u s state on continental north america about of british columbia canada separates alaska from washington state
alaska is thus an exclave of the united states possibly the largest exclave in the world
it is technically part of the continental u s but is often not included in colloquial use alaska is not part of the contiguous u s often called the lower 48
the capital city juneau is situated on the mainland of the north american continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the north american highway system
the state is bordered by yukon and british columbia in canada to the east the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south the bering sea bering strait and chukchi sea to the west and the arctic ocean to the north
alaska s territorial waters touch russia s territorial waters in the bering strait as the russian big diomede island and alaskan little diomede island are only apart
with the extension of the aleutian islands into the eastern hemisphere it is technically both the westernmost and easternmost state in the united states as well as also being the northernmost
alaska is the largest state in the united states in land area at over twice the size of texas the next largest state
alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries
counting territorial waters alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states texas california and montana
it is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest u s states
regions there are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of alaska but there are six widely accepted regions south central the most populous region of alaska containing anchorage the matanuska susitna valley and the kenai peninsula
rural mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of southcentral as well as the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova and valdez
southeast also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage this is the region of alaska closest to the rest of the united states
as such this was where most of the initial non indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase
the region is dominated by the alexander archipelago as well as the tongass national forest the largest national forest in the united states
it contains the state capital juneau the former capital sitka and ketchikan at one time alaska s largest city
the alaska marine highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area as only three communities haines hyder and skagway enjoy direct connections to the contiguous north american road system
interior the largest region of alaska much of the interior is uninhabited wilderness
fairbanks is the only large city in the region
small towns and native villages are scattered throughout mostly along the highway and river systems
denali national park and preserve is located here home to mount mckinley also widely known by its local name of denali the highest point in north america
southwest southwest alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some inland from the bering sea
most of the population lives along the coast
kodiak island is also located in southwest
the massive yukon – kuskokwim delta one of the largest river deltas in the world is here
portions of the alaska peninsula are considered part of southwest with the remaining portions included with the aleutian islands see below
north slope the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages
the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the national petroleum reserve – alaska and the prudhoe bay oil field
barrow the northernmost city in the united states is located here
the northwest arctic area anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley is often regarded as being part of this region
however the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom think of themselves as one
aleutian islands more than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain which stretches over into the pacific ocean
the international date line was drawn west of 180 ° to keep the whole state and thus the entire north american continent within the same legal day
however because some of these islands fall in the eastern hemisphere this makes alaska the northernmost easternmost and westernmost state in the union with the southernmost state being hawaii
two of the islands attu and kiska were occupied by japanese forces during world war ii
natural features with its myriad islands alaska has nearly of tidal shoreline
the aleutian islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the alaska peninsula
many active volcano es are found in the aleutians and in coastal regions
unimak island for example is home to mount shishaldin which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to above the north pacific
it is the most perfect volcanic cone on earth even more symmetrical than japan s mount fuji
the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr west of anchorage on the mainland
geologists have identified alaska as part of wrangellia a large region consisting of multiple states and canadian provinces in the pacific northwest which is actively undergoing continent building
one of the world s largest tides occurs in turnagain arm just south of anchorage – tidal differences can be more than
many sources say turnagain has the second greatest tides in north america but several areas in canada have larger tides
alaska has more than three million lakes
marshland s and wetland permafrost cover mostly in northern western and southwest flatlands
glacier ice covers some of land and of tidal zone
the bering glacier complex near the southeastern border with yukon covers alone
with over 100 000 alaska has half of the world s glaciers
land ownership according to an october 1998 report by the united states bureau of land management approximately 65 of alaska is owned and managed by the u s federal government as public lands including a multitude of national forests national parks and national wildlife refuge s of these the bureau of land management manages or 23 8 of the state
the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service
it is the world s largest wildlife refuge comprising
of the remaining land area the state of alaska owns its entitlement under the alaska statehood act
a portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs
smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading related opportunities though these are infrequently popular due to the often remote and roadless locations
the university of alaska as a land grant university also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently
another are owned by 12 regional and scores of local native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act
regional native corporation doyon limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications
provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect
effectively the corporations hold title including subsurface title in many cases a privilege denied to individual alaskans but can not sell the land
individual native allotments can be and are sold on the open market however
various private interests own the remaining land totaling about one percent of the state
alaska is by a large margin the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when native corporation holdings are excluded
climate the climate in southeast alaska is a mid latitude oceanic climate köppen climate classification cfb in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate köppen cfc in the northern parts
on an annual basis southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year
juneau averages over of precipitation a year and ketchikan averages over
this is also the only region in alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months
the climate of anchorage and south central alaska is mild by alaskan standards due to the region s proximity to the seacoast
while the area gets less rain than southeast alaska it gets more snow and days tend to be clearer
on average anchorage receives of precipitation a year with around of snow although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow
it is a subarctic climate köppen dfc due to its brief cool summers
the climate of western alaska is determined in large part by the bering sea and the gulf of alaska
it is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north
the temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is
this region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation
an area stretching from the northern side of the seward peninsula to the kobuk river valley is technically a desert with portions receiving less than of precipitation annually
on the other extreme some locations between dillingham and bethel average around of precipitation
the climate of the interior of alaska is subarctic
some of the highest and lowest temperatures in alaska occur around the area near fairbanks
the summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s ° f the low to mid 30s ° c while in the winter the temperature can fall below
precipitation is sparse in the interior often less than a year but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter
the highest and lowest recorded temperatures in alaska are both in the interior
the highest is in fort yukon which is just inside the arctic circle on june 27 1915 making alaska tied with hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the united states
the lowest official alaska temperature is in prospect creek on january 23 1971 one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental north america in snag yukon canada
the climate in the extreme north of alaska is arctic köppen et with long very cold winters and short cool summers
even in july the average low temperature in barrow is
precipitation is light in this part of alaska with many places averaging less than per year mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year
history alaska natives numerous indigenous people occupied alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of european peoples to the area
the tlingit people developed a matrilineal society in what is today southeast alaska along with parts of british columbia and the yukon
also in southeast were the haida now well known for their unique arts
the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in 1887 when president grover cleveland and later the u s congress granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla
all three of these peoples as well as other indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid 19th century with the most devastating epidemics arriving in the 1830s and 1860s
the aleutian islands are still home to the aleut people s seafaring society although they were the first native alaskans to be exploited by russians
western and southwestern alaska are home to the yup ik while their cousins the alutiiq lived in what is now southcentral alaska
the gwich ’ in people of the northern interior region are primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much contested arctic national wildlife refuge
the north slope and little diomede island are occupied by the widespread inuit people
colonization some researchers believe that the first russian settlement in alaska was established in 17th century
according to this hypothesis in 1648 several koch es of semyon dezhnyov s expedition were thrown to alaska by storm and founded this settlement
this hypothesis is based on the message of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin who had visited alaska in 1764 – 1765 and reported about a village on the kheuveren river populated by bearded men who pray to the icons
some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river
it is usually assumed that the first european boat to reach alaska was the st gabriel under the authority of the surveyor m s gvozdev and assistant navigator i fyodorov on august 21 1732 during expedition of siberian cossak a f shestakov and belorussian explorer d i pavlutsky 1729 — 1735 another european contact with alaska occurred in 1741 when vitus bering led an expedition for the russian navy aboard the st peter
after his crew returned to russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of siberia towards the aleutian islands
the first permanent european settlement was founded in 1784
between 1774 and 1800 spain sent several expeditions to alaska in order to assert its claim over the pacific northwest
in 1789 a spanish settlement and fort were built in nootka sound
these expeditions gave names to places such as valdez bucareli sound and cordova
later the russian american company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early to mid 19th century
sitka renamed new archangel from 1804 to 1867 on baranof island in the alexander archipelago in what is now southeast alaska became the capital of russian america and remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the united states
the russians never fully colonized alaska and the colony was never very profitable
william h seward the united states secretary of state negotiated the alaska purchase also known as seward s folly with the russians in 1867 for 7 2 million
alaska was loosely governed by the military initially and was administered as a district starting in 1884 with a governor appointed by the president of the united states as well as a district court headquartered in sitka
for most of alaska s first decade under the american flag sitka was the only community inhabited by american settlers
they organized a provisional city government which was alaska s first city government but not in a legal sense
legislation allowing alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900 and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect
u s territory starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s gold rushes in alaska and the nearby yukon territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to alaska
alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912
alaska s capital which had been in sitka until 1906 was moved north to juneau and began to take shape with the construction of the alaska governor s mansion that same year
during world war ii the aleutian islands campaign focused on the three outer aleutian islands – attu agattu and kiska – that were invaded by japanese troops and occupied between june 1942 and august 1943
unalaska dutch harbor became a significant base for the u s army air corps and navy submariners
the u s lend lease program involved the flying of american warplanes through canada to fairbanks and thence nome soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft ferrying them to fight the german invasion of the soviet union
the construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some alaskan cities
statehood statehood for alaska was an important cause of james wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate
decades later the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946
the alaska statehood committee and alaska s constitutional convention would soon follow
statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes mostly in the u s congress but also within alaska
statehood was approved by congress on july 7 1958
alaska was officially proclaimed a state on january 3 1959
on march 27 1964 the massive good friday earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides
it was the third most powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world with a moment magnitude of 9 2
it was over one thousand times more powerful than the 1989 san francisco earthquake
the time of day 5 36 pm time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives particularly in anchorage
the 1968 discovery of oil at prudhoe bay and the 1977 completion of the trans alaska pipeline led to an oil boom
royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward
that same year not coincidentally alaska repealed its state income tax
in 1989 the exxon valdez hit a reef in the prince william sound spilling over of crude oil over 1 100 miles 1 600 km of coastline
today the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge
demographics the united states census bureau estimates that the population of alaska was 731 449 on july 1 2012 a 3 0 increase since the 2010 united states census
in 2010 alaska ranked as the 47th state by population ahead of north dakota vermont and wyoming and washington d c alaska is the least densely populated state and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world at with the next state wyoming at
alaska is the largest u s state by area and the tenth wealthiest per capita income
as of april 2012 the state s unemployment rate was 6 9
race and ancestry according to the 2010 united states census alaska had a population of 710 231
in terms of race and ethnicity the state was 66 7 white 64 1 non hispanic white 14 8 american indian and alaska native 5 4 asian 3 3 black or african american 1 0 native hawaiian and other pacific islander 1 6 from some other race and 7 3 from two or more races
hispanics or latinos of any race made up 5 5 of the population
in 1960 the census bureau reported alaska s population as 77 2 white 3 black and 18 8 american indian and alaska native
as of 2011 50 7 of alaska s population younger than age 1 were minorities
languages according to the 2005 – 2007 american community survey 84 7 of people over the age of five speak only english at home
about 3 5 speak spanish at home
about 2 2 speak another indo european language at home and about 4 3 speak an asian language at home
and about 5 3 speak other languages at home
a total of 5 2 of alaskans speak one of the state s 22 indigenous languages known locally as native languages
these languages belong to two major language families eskimo – aleut and na dene
as the homeland of these two major language families of north america alaska has been described as the crossroads of the continent providing evidence for the recent settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge
religion alaska has been identified along with pacific northwest states washington and oregon as being the least religious in the u s
according to statistics collected by the association of religion data archives about 39 of alaska residents were members of religious congregations
evangelical protestant s had 78 070 members roman catholics had 54 359 and mainline protestants had 37 156
after catholicism the largest single denominations are the church of jesus christ of latter day saints with 30 169 and southern baptists with 22 959
the large eastern orthodox with 49 parishes and up to 50 000 followers population is a result of early russian colonization and missionary work among alaska natives
in 1795 the first russian orthodox church was established in kodiak
intermarriage with alaskan natives helped the russian immigrants integrate into society
as a result an increasing number of russian orthodox churches gradually became established within alaska
alaska also has the largest quaker population by percentage of any state
in 2009 there were 6 000 jews in alaska for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems
estimates for the number of alaskan muslims range from 2 000 to 5 000
in 2010 the local muslim community broke ground on the first mosque in the state
alaskan hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other religious communities including sikhs and jains
economy the 2007 gross state product was 44 9 billion 45th in the nation
its per capita personal income for 2007 was 40 042 ranking 15th in the nation
the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy with more than 80 of the state s revenues derived from petroleum extraction
alaska s main export product excluding oil and natural gas is seafood primarily salmon cod pollock and crab
agriculture represents only a fraction of the alaskan economy
agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables and livestock
manufacturing is limited with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere
employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation
military bases are a significant component of the economy in both fairbanks and anchorage
federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy allowing the state to keep taxes low
its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and wood products
there is also a growing service and tourism sector
tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging
largest employers according to the alaska department of labor and workforce development the following were the state s largest private sector employers in 2010 energy alaska has vast energy resources
major oil and gas reserves are found in the alaska north slope ans and cook inlet basins
according to the energy information administration alaska ranks second in the nation in crude oil production
prudhoe bay on alaska s north slope is the highest yielding oil field in the united states and on north america typically producing about
the trans alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to of crude oil per day more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states
additionally substantial coal deposits are found in alaska s bituminous sub bituminous and lignite coal basins
the united states geological survey estimates that there are of undiscovered technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope
alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers
large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well
alaska s economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating transportation electric power and light
though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped proposals for state wide energy systems e g with special low cost electric interties were judged uneconomical at the time of the report 2001 due to low file alaska crude oil reserves
png alaska oil reserves peaked in 1978 and have declined 60 thereafter file alaska crude oil production
png alaska oil production peaked in 1988 and has declined 65 since permanent fundthe alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil largely in anticipation of same from the recently constructed trans alaska pipeline system
the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale which amounted to 900 million at once and was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone
it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund
the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose
the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation
from its initial principal of 734 000 the fund has grown to 40 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs
most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska
this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska though such a stance has never really gained momentum
starting in 1982 dividends from the fund s annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans ranging from an initial 1 000 00 in 1982 equal to three years payout as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme to 3 269 00 in 2008 which included a one time 1 200 00 resource rebate
every year the state legislature takes out 8 percent from the earnings puts 3 percent back into the principal for inflation proofing and the remaining 5 percent is distributed to all qualifying alaskans
to qualify for the permanent fund dividend one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment
cost of living the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states
this has changed for the most part in anchorage and to a lesser extent in fairbanks where the cost of living has dropped somewhat in the past five years
federal government employees particularly united states postal service usps workers and active duty military members receive a cost of living allowance usually set at 25 of base pay because while the cost of living has gone down it is still one of the highest in the country
the introduction of big box store s in anchorage fairbanks and juneau also did much to lower prices
wal mart opened their first anchorage store in 1993 and debuted in fairbanks in 2004
the company currently has locations covering most of the population centers of alaska including juneau ketchikan and kodiak
however rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure
many rural residents come into these cities and purchase food and goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like costco and sam s club
some have embraced the free shipping offers of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities if they are available at all
agriculture and fishing due to the northern climate and short growing season relatively little farming occurs in alaska
most farms are in either the matanuska valley about northeast of anchorage or on the kenai peninsula about southwest of anchorage
the short 100 day growing season limits the crops that can be grown but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons
the primary crops are potatoes carrots lettuce and cabbage
the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus especially delta junction area about southeast of fairbanks with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely
this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor
delta area crops consist predominately of barley and hay
west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants the hotel and tourist industry and community supported agriculture
alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardener s small farms and farmers market s in recent years with the highest percentage increase 46 in the nation in growth in farmers markets in 2011 compared to 17 nationwide
the peony industry has also taken off as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world thereby filling a niche in the flower market
alaska with no counties also lacks county fairs
however a small assortment of state and local fairs with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest are held mostly in the late summer
the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high profile commercial activities such as carnival rides concerts and food
alaska grown is used as an agricultural slogan
alaska has an abundance of seafood with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific and seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it
many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence as well as sport
this includes fish taken by hook net or wheel
hunting for subsistence primarily caribou moose and dall sheep is still common in the state particularly in remote bush communities
an example of a traditional native food is akutaq the eskimo ice cream which can consist of reindeer fat seal oil dried fish meat and local berries
alaska s reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer
most food in alaska is transported into the state from outside and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive
in rural areas subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive
the cost of importing food to villages begins at 7 ¢ per pound 15 ¢ kg and rises rapidly to 50 ¢ per pound 1 10 kg or more
the cost of delivering a of milk is about 3 50 in many villages where per capita income can be 20 000 or less
fuel cost can exceed 8 00 per gallon
transportation roads alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the u s
the state s road system covers a relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the alaska highway the principal route out of the state through canada
the state capital juneau is not accessible by road only a car ferry which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system or building a road connection from haines
the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska
one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier on prince william sound to the seward highway about southeast of anchorage at portage
at the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until 2007
the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america
rail built around 1915 the alaska railroad arr played a key role in the development of alaska through the 20th century
it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward to interior alaska by way of south central alaska passing through anchorage eklutna wasilla talkeetna denali and fairbanks with spurs to whittier palmer and north pole
the cities towns villages and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as the railbelt
in recent years the ever improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad s importance in alaska s economy
the railroad though famed for its summertime tour passenger service played a vital role in alaska s development moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward i e coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage
the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use caboose s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains
it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country
a stretch of about of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area until construction of the parks highway in the 1970s the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route
in northern southeast alaska the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway northwards into canada british columbia and yukon territory crossing the border at white pass summit
this line is now mainly used by tourists often arriving by cruise liner at skagway
it featured in the 1983 bbc television series great little railways
the alaska rail network is not connected to outside
in 2000 the u s congress authorized 6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between alaska canada and the lower 48
alaska rail marine provides car float service between whittier and seattle
marine transport many cities towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access the only modes of access involve travel by air river or the sea
alaska s well developed state owned ferry system known as the alaska marine highway serves the cities of southeast the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula
the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers
the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham washington and prince rupert british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway
the inter island ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway
in recent years cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and to a lesser degree towns along alaska s gulf coast
the population of ketchikan may rise by over 10 000 people on many days during the summer as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock debarking thousands of passengers
air transport cities not served by road sea or river can be reached only by air foot dogsled or snowmachine accounting for alaska s extremely well developed bush air services — an alaskan novelty
anchorage itself and to a lesser extent fairbanks are served by many major airlines
because of limited highway access air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state
anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism in 2000 – 2001 the latest year for which data is available 2 4 million total arrivals to alaska were counted 1 7 million by air travel 1 4 million were visitors
regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the essential air service program
alaska airlines is the only major airline offering in state travel with jet service sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing 737 400 s from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel nome kotzebue dillingham kodiak and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities
the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as era aviation penair and frontier flying service
the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state
much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities
the program requires 70 of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities
many communities have small air taxi services
these operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas
perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane
the world s busiest seaplane base is lake hood located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers cargo and many items from stores and warehouse clubs
alaska has the highest number of pilots per capita of any u s state out of the estimated 663 661 residents 8 550 are pilots or about one in 78
other transport another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled
in modern times that is any time after the mid late 1920s dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation
various races are held around the state but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race a 1150 mile 1850 km trail from anchorage to nome although the distance varies from year to year the official distance is set at
the race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo and balto took much needed medicine to the diphtheria stricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed
mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash prizes and prestige
the serum run is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay leaving from the community of nenana southwest of fairbanks to nome
in areas not served by road or rail primary transportation in summer is by all terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or snow machine as it is commonly referred to in alaska
data transport alaska s internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies gci and alaska communications
gci owns and operates what it calls the alaska united fiber optic system and as of late 2011 alaska communications advertised that it has two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across alaska
in january 2011 it was reported that a 1 billion project to run connect asia and rural alaska was being planned aided in part by 350 million in stimulus from the federal government
law and government state government like all other u s states alaska is governed as a republic with three branches of government an executive branch consisting of the governor of alaska and the other independently elected constitutional officers a legislative branch consisting of the alaska house of representatives and alaska senate and a judicial branch consisting of the alaska supreme court and lower courts
the state of alaska employs approximately 15 000 employees statewide
the alaska legislature consists of a 40 member house of representatives and a 20 member senate
senators serve four year terms and house members two
the governor of alaska serves four year terms
the lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries but during the general election the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket
alaska s court system has four levels the alaska supreme court the court of appeals the superior courts and the district courts
the superior and district courts are trial court s superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction while district courts only hear certain types of cases including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to 100 000
the supreme court and the court of appeals are appellate court s the court of appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower court decisions including those regarding criminal prosecutions juvenile delinquency and habeas corpus
the supreme court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals
state politics although alaska entered the union as a democratic state since the early 1970s alaska has been characterized as a republican leaning state
local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development fishing tourism and individual rights
alaska native s while organized in and around their communities have been active within the native corporations
these have been given ownership over large tracts of land which require stewardship
alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one s home was completely legal under state law though the federal law remains in force
the state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the united states with the alaskan independence party
six republicans and four democrats have served as governor of alaska
in addition republican governor wally hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the republican party and briefly joining the alaskan independence party ticket just long enough to be reelected
he subsequently officially rejoined the republican party in 1994
taxes to finance state government operations alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies
this allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the united states and be one of only five states with no state sales tax one of seven states that do not levy an individual income tax and one of two states that has neither
the department of revenue tax division reports regularly on the state s revenue sources
the department also issues an annual summary of its operations including new state laws that directly affect the tax division
while alaska has no state sales tax 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax from 1 – 7 5 typically 3 – 5
other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes hotel motel and bed and breakfast bed taxes severance tax es liquor and tobacco taxes gaming pull tabs taxes tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes
a part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees such as petroleum aviation motor fuel telephone cooperative is shared with municipalities in alaska
fairbanks has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the fairbanks north star borough fnsb
a sales tax for the fnsb has been voted on many times but has yet to be approved leading law makers to increase taxes dramatically on other goods such as liquor and tobacco
in 2008 the tax foundation ranked alaska as having the 4th most business friendly tax policy
more friendly states were wyoming nevada and south dakota
federal politics in presidential elections the state s electoral college votes have been won by the republican nominee in every election since statehood except for 1964
no state has voted for a democratic presidential candidate fewer times
alaska supported democratic nominee lyndon b johnson in the landslide year of 1964 and the 1960 and 1968 elections were close
since 1972 however republicans have carried the state by large margins
in 2008 republican john mccain defeated democrat barack obama in alaska 59 49 to 37 83
mccain s running mate was sarah palin the state s governor and the first alaskan on a major party ticket
the alaska bush central juneau midtown and downtown anchorage and the areas surrounding the university of alaska fairbanks campus and ester have been strongholds of the democratic party
the matanuska susitna borough the majority of fairbanks including north pole and the military base and south anchorage typically have the strongest republican showing
as of 2004 well over half of all registered voters have chosen non partisan or undeclared as their affiliation despite recent attempts to close primaries
because of its population relative to other u s states alaska has only one member in the u s house of representatives
this seat is currently being held by republican don young who was re elected to his 21st consecutive term in 2012
alaska s at large congressional district is currently the world s second largest legislative constituency by area behind only the canadian territory of nunavut
in 2008 governor sarah palin became the first republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became john mccain s vice presidential running mate
she continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor s job in july 2009
alaska s united states senators belong to class 2 and class 3
in 2008 democrat mark begich mayor of anchorage defeated long time republican senator ted stevens
stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on senate financial discloser forms one week before the election
the conviction was set aside in april 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged
republican frank murkowski held the state s other senatorial position
after being elected governor in 2002 he resigned from the senate and appointed his daughter state representative lisa murkowski as his successor
she won a full six year term in 2004 and 2010
cities towns and boroughs alaska is not divided into counties as most of the other u s states but it is divided into boroughs
many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of alaska s 16 boroughs which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states
however unlike county equivalents in the other 49 states the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state
the area not part of any borough is referred to as the unorganized borough
the unorganized borough has no government of its own but the u s census bureau in cooperation with the state divided the unorganized borough into 11 census area s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation
a recording district is a mechanism for administration of the public record in alaska
the state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a state recorder
all recording districts use the same acceptance criteria fee schedule etc for accepting documents into the public record
whereas many u s states use a three tiered system of decentralization — state county township — most of alaska uses only two tiers — state borough
owing to the low population density most of the land is located in the unorganized borough which as the name implies has no intermediate borough government of its own but is administered directly by the state government
currently 2000 census 57 71 of alaska s area has this status with 13 05 of the population
for statistical purposes the united states census bureau divides this territory into census area s anchorage merged the city government with the greater anchorage area borough in 1975 to form the municipality of anchorage containing the city proper and the communities of eagle river chugiak peters creek girdwood bird and indian
fairbanks has a separate borough the fairbanks north star borough and municipality the city of fairbanks
the state s most populous city is anchorage home to 278 700 people in 2006 225 744 of whom live in the urbanized area
the richest location in alaska by per capita income is halibut cove 89 895
yakutat city sitka juneau and anchorage are the four largest cities in the u s by area
cities and census designated places by population alaska has a total of 355 cities and census designated place s the majority of these are located in the rural expanse of alaska known as the bush and are unconnected to the contiguous north american road network
the 100 largest cities and census designated places in alaska are listed below in population order out of alaska s 2010 census population figure of 710 231 20 429 people or 2 88 of the population do not live in an incorporated city or census designated place
approximately 3 4 of that figure are people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of ketchikan kodiak palmer and wasilla in areas where census designated places have not been created by the census bureau
the remainder are scattered throughout alaska both within organized boroughs and in the unorganized borough
education the alaska department of education and early development administers many school districts in alaska
in addition the state operates a boarding school mt edgecumbe high school in sitka and provides partial funding for other boarding schools including nenana student living center in nenana and the galena interior learning academy in galena
there are more than a dozen colleges and universities in alaska
accredited universities in alaska include the university of alaska anchorage university of alaska fairbanks university of alaska southeast and alaska pacific university
alaska is the only state that has no institutions that are part of the ncaa division i program
the alaska department of labor and workforce development operates avtec alaska s institute of technology
campuses in seward and anchorage offer 1 week to 11 month training programs in areas as diverse as information technology welding nursing and mechanics
alaska has had a problem with a brain drain
many of its young people including most of the highest academic achievers leave the state after high school graduation and do not return
the university of alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four year scholarships to the top 10 of alaska high school graduates via the alaska scholars program
public health and public safety the alaska state troopers are alaska s statewide police force
they have a long and storied history but were not an official organization until 1941
before the force was officially organized law enforcement in alaska was handled by various federal agencies
larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on public safety officers who have police training but do not carry firearms
in much of the state the troopers serve as the only police force available
in addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law wildlife troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations
due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the troopers duties they employ a wide variety of land air and water patrol vehicles
many rural communities in alaska are considered dry having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages
suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban
domestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state this is in part linked to alcohol abuse
alaska also has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation
the average age of sexually assaulted victims is 16 years old
in four out of five cases the suspects were relatives friends or acquaintances
culture some of alaska s popular annual events are the iditarod trail sled dog race that starts in anchorage and ends in nome world ice art championships in fairbanks the alaska hummingbird festival in ketchikan the sitka whale fest and the stikine river garnet fest in wrangell
the stikine river features the largest springtime concentration of american bald eagle s in the world
the alaska native heritage center celebrates the rich heritage of alaska s 11 cultural groups
their purpose is to enhance self esteem among native people and to encourage cross cultural exchanges among all people
the alaska native arts foundation promotes and markets native art from all regions and cultures in the state both on the internet at its gallery in anchorage 500 west sixth avenue and at the alaska house new york 109 mercer street in soho
music influences on music in alaska include the traditional music of alaska natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from russia and europe
prominent musicians from alaska include singer jewel traditional aleut flautist mary youngblood folk singer songwriter libby roderick christian music singer songwriter lincoln brewster metal post hardcore band 36 crazyfists and the groups pamyua and portugal the man
there are many established music festivals in alaska including the alaska folk festival the fairbanks summer arts festival the anchorage folk festival the athabascan old time fiddling festival the sitka jazz festival and the sitka summer music festival
the most prominent orchestra in alaska is the anchorage symphony orchestra though the fairbanks symphony orchestra and juneau symphony are also notable the anchorage opera is currently the state s only professional opera company though there are several volunteer and semi professional organizations in the state as well
the official state song of alaska is alaska s flag which was adopted in 1955 it celebrates the flag of alaska
alaska in film and on television alaska s first independent picture all made on place was in the silent years
the chechahcos was produced by alaskan businessman austin e lathrop and filmed in and around anchorage
it was released in 1924 by the alaska moving picture corporation and was the only film the company made
one of the most prominent movies filmed in alaska is mgm s eskimo mala the magnificent starring alaska native ray mala
in 1932 an expedition set out from mgm s studios in hollywood to alaska to film what was then billed as the biggest picture ever made
upon arriving in alaska they set up camp hollywood in northwest alaska where they lived during the duration of the filming
louis b mayer spared no expense in spite of the remote location going so far as to hire the chef from the hotel roosevelt in hollywood to prepare meals
when eskimo premiered at the astor theatre in new york city the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history to that point
eskimo was critically acclaimed and released worldwide as a result mala became an international movie star
eskimo won the first oscar for best film editing at the academy awards and was also responsible for showcasing and preserving aspects of inupiat culture on film
the 1983 disney movie never cry wolf was at least partially shot in alaska
the 1991 film white fang starring ethan hawke was filmed in and around haines alaska
steven seagal s 1994 on deadly ground starring michael caine was filmed in part at the worthington glacier near valdez
the 1999 john sayles film limbo starring david strathairn mary elizabeth mastrantonio and kris kristofferson was filmed in juneau
the psychological thriller insomnia starring al pacino and robin williams was shot in canada but was set in alaska
the 2007 film directed by sean penn into the wild was partially filmed and set in alaska
the film which is based on the novel of the same name follows the adventures of christopher mccandless who died in a remote abandoned bus along the stampede trail west of healy in 1992
many films and television shows set in alaska are not filmed there for example northern exposure set in the fictional town of cicely alaska was actually filmed in roslyn washington
the 2007 horror feature 30 days of night is set in barrow but was filmed in new zealand
many reality television shows are filmed in alaska
in 2011 the anchorage daily news found ten set in the state
state symbols alaska heritage resources survey the alaska heritage resources survey ahrs is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the state of alaska and is maintained by the office of history and archaeology
the survey s inventory of cultural resources includes objects structures buildings sites districts and travel ways with a general provision that they are over 50 years old
as of january 31 2012 over 35 000 sites have been reported

agriculture also called farming or husbandry is the cultivation of animals plant s fungi and other life forms for food fiber biofuel and other products used to sustain human life
agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization
the study of agriculture is known as agricultural science
the history of agriculture dates back thousands of years and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climate s cultures and technologies
however all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species
for plants this usually requires some form of irrigation although there are methods of dryland farming pastoral herding on rangeland is still the most common means of raising livestock
in the developed world industrial agriculture based on large scale monoculture has become the dominant system of modern farming although there is growing support for sustainable agriculture e g permaculture or organic agriculture
until the industrial revolution the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture
pre industrial agriculture was typically subsistence agriculture in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own consumption instead of for trade
a remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies and the development of world markets
this also led to technological improvements in agricultural techniques such as the haber bosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate which made the traditional practice of recycling nutrient s with crop rotation and animal manure less necessary
modern agronomy plant breeding and agrochemical s such as pesticide s and fertilizers and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects
selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry such as intensive pig farming have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and the health effects of the antibiotics growth hormones and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production
the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods fibers fuel s and raw material s specific foods include cereal s vegetable s fruit s and meat
fibers include cotton wool hemp silk and flax
raw materials include lumber and bamboo
other useful materials are produced by plants such as resin s biofuels include methane from biomass ethanol and biodiesel
cut flowers nursery plants tropical fish and birds for the pet trade are some of the ornamental products
agricultural food production and water management is targeted as an increasingly global issue that is fostering an important and growing debate
in 2011 one third of the world s workers were employed in agriculture second only to the services sector
despite the size of its workforce agricultural production accounts for less than five percent of the gross world product an aggregate of all gross domestic product s
etymology and terminology agriculture generally speaking refers to human activities although it is also observed in certain species of ant and termite
the word agriculture is the english adaptation of latin agricultūra from ager a field and cultūra cultivation in the strict sense of tillage of the soil
thus a literal reading of the word yields tillage of fields
history agricultural practices such as irrigation crop rotation fertilizers pesticides and animals were developed a long time ago but have made great progress in the past century
the history of agriculture has played a major role in human history as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide socio economic change
division of labor in agricultural societies made commonplace specializations rarely seen in hunter gatherer cultures
so too are arts such as epic literature and monumental architecture as well as codified legal systems
when farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families others in their society were freed to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition
historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible
the total world population probably never exceeded 15 million inhabitants before the development of agriculture
prehistoric origins forest gardening a plant based food production system is thought to be the world s oldest agroecosystem
forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle clad river banks and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions
in the gradual process of a family improving their immediate environment useful tree and vine species were identified protected and improved whilst undesirable species were eliminated
eventually superior foreign species were selected and incorporated into the family s garden
ancient history the fertile crescent of the near east first saw the domestication of animals starting the neolithic revolution
between 10 000 and 13 000 years ago the ancestors of modern cattle sheep goats and pigs were domesticated in this area
the gradual transition from wild harvesting to deliberate cultivation happened independently in several areas around the globe
agriculture allowed for the support of an increased population leading to larger societies and eventually the development of cities
it also created the need for greater organization of political power and the creation of social stratification as decisions had to be made regarding labor and harvest allocation and access rights to water and land
agriculture bred immobility as populations settled down for long periods of time which led to the accumulation of material goods
early neolithic villages show evidence of the ability to process grain and the near east is the ancient home of the ancestors of wheat barley and pea s there is evidence of the cultivation of fig s in the jordan valley as long as 11 300 years ago and cereal production in syria approximately 9 000 years ago
during the same period farmers in china began to farm rice and millet using man made floods and fires as part of their cultivation regimen
squash was grown in mexico nearly 10 000 years ago while maize like plants derived from the wild teosinte began to be seen at around 9 000 years ago
the derivation of teosinte into modern corn was slow however and it took until 5 500 to 6 000 years ago to turn into what we know today as maize
it then gradually spread across north america and was the major crop of native americans at the time of european exploration
bean s were domesticated around the same time and together these three plants formed the three sisters nutritional foundation of many native populations in north and central america
combined with peppers these crops provided a balanced diet for much of the continent
a 2007 study found evidence of the domestication of manioc and arrowroot in what is now panama that possibly dated back over 7 500 years 5200 bc
agriculture advanced to europe slightly later reaching the northeast of the continent from the east around 4000 bc
the idea that agriculture spread to europe rather than independently developing there has led to two main hypotheses
the first is a wave of advance which holds that agriculture traveled slowly and steadily across the continent while the second population pulse theory holds that it moved in jumps
around 5 000 years ago sunflower s were first cultivated in north america while south america s andes region was developing the potato
a minor center of domestication the indigenous people of the eastern u s appear to have domesticated numerous crops
in addition to sunflowers tobacco varieties of squash and chenopodium as well as crops no longer grown including marshelder and little barley were domesticated
other wild foods may have undergone some selective cultivation including wild rice and maple sugar
the most common varieties of strawberry were domesticated from eastern north america
between 2500 and 2000 bc the simplest form of the plough called the ard spread throughout europe replacing the hoe
this change in equipment significantly increased cultivation ability and affected the demand for land as well as ideas about property inheritance and family rights
before this period simple digging stick s or hoes were used
these tools would have also been easier to transport which was a benefit as people only stayed until the soil s nutrients were depleted
however through excavations in mexico it has been found that the continuous cultivating of smaller pieces of land would also have been a sustaining practice
additional research in central europe later revealed that agriculture was indeed practiced at this method
for this method ards were thus much more efficient than digging sticks
middle ages the middle ages saw significant improvements in the agricultural techniques and technology
during this time period monasteries originally developed in greece and the middle east spread throughout europe and became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry
the manorial system which existed under different names throughout europe and asia allowed large landowners significant control over both their land and its laborers in the form of peasants or serf s by 900 ad in europe developments in iron smelting allowed for increased production leading to developments in the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs hand tools and horse shoe s the plough was significantly improved developing into the mouldboard plough capable of turning over the heavy wet soils of northern europe
this led to the clearing of forests in that area and a significant increase in agricultural production which in turn led to an increase in population
at the same time farmers in europe moved from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year
this resulted in increased productivity and nutrition as the change in rotations led to different crops being planted including legumes such as peas lentils and beans
inventions such as improved horse harness es and the whippletree also changed methods of cultivation
watermill s were initially developed by the romans but were improved throughout the middle ages along with windmill s and used to grind grains into flour cut wood and process flax and wool among other uses
crops were wheat rye barley and oats
peas bean s and vetches became common from the 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals and also for their nitrogen fixation fertilizing properties
crop yields peaked in the 13th century and according to bruce campbell and mark overton stayed more or less steady until the 18th century
though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the middle ages recent studies by campbell and david stone have shown that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times such as the terrible weather of 1315 – 17 that the needs of the population could not be met
modern developments after 1492 a global exchange of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred
key crops involved in this exchange included the tomato maize potato manioc cocoa bean and tobacco going from the new world to the old and several varieties of wheat spices coffee and sugar cane going from the old world to the new
the most important animal exportation from the old world to the new were those of the horse and dog dogs were already present in the pre columbian americas but not in the numbers and breeds suited to farm work
although not usually food animals the horse including donkeys and dog quickly filled essential production roles on western hemisphere farms
the potato became an important staple crop in northern europe
since being introduced by portuguese in the 16th century maize and manioc have replaced traditional african crops as the continent s most important staple food crops
by the early 19th century agricultural techniques implements seed stocks and cultivar had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages
although there is a vast and interesting history of crop cultivation before the dawn of the 20th century there is little question that the work of charles darwin and gregor mendel created the scientific foundation for plant breeding that led to its explosive impact over the past 150 years
with the rapid rise of mechanization in the late 19th century and the 20th century particularly in the form of the tractor farming tasks could be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible
these advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the united states argentina israel the united kingdom germany and a few other nations to output volumes of high quality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit
the haber bosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints
in the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor water pollution and farm subsidies
in recent years there has been a backlash against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture resulting in the organic movement
the cereals rice corn and wheat provide 60 of human food supply
between 1700 and 1980 the total area of cultivated land worldwide increased 466 and yields increased dramatically particularly because of selectively bred high yielding varieties fertilizers pesticides irrigation and machinery
for example irrigation increased corn yields in eastern colorado by 400 to 500 from 1940 to 1997
however concerns have been raised over the sustainability of intensive agriculture
intensive agriculture has become associated with decreased soil quality in india and asia and there has been increased concern over the effects of fertilizers and pesticides on the environment particularly as population increases and food demand expands
the monocultures typically used in intensive agriculture increase the number of pests which are controlled through pesticides
integrated pest management ipm which has been promoted for decades and has had some notable successes has not significantly affected the use of pesticides because policies encourage the use of pesticides and ipm is knowledge intensive
agricultural exploration expeditions since the late 19th century have been mounted to find new species and new agricultural practices in different areas of the world
two early examples of expeditions include frank n meyer s fruit and nut collecting trip to china and japan from 1916 to 1918 and the dorsett morse oriental agricultural exploration expedition to china japan and korea from 1929 – 1931 to collect soybean germplasm to support the rise in soybean agriculture in the united states
in the 21st century plants have been used to grow biofuels pharmaceutical s including biopharmaceutical s bioplastic s green revolution the green revolution refers to a series of research development and technology transfer initiatives occurring between the 1940s and the late 1970s that increased agriculture production around the world beginning most markedly in the late 1960s
the initiatives led by norman borlaug the father of the green revolution credited with saving over a billion people from starvation involved the development of high yielding varieties of cereal grains expansion of irrigation infrastructure modernization of management techniques distribution of hybridized seeds synthetic fertilizer s and pesticide s to farmers
synthetic nitrogen along with mined rock phosphate pesticides and mechanization have greatly increased crop yields in the early 20th century
increased supply of grain s has led to cheaper livestock as well
further global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice wheat and corn maize were introduced as a part of the green revolution
the green revolution exported the technologies including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen of the developed world to the developing world
thomas malthus famously predicted that the earth would not be able to support its growing population but technologies such as the green revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food
although the green revolution significantly increased rice yields in asia yield increases have not occurred in the past 15 – 20 years
the genetic yield potential has increased for wheat but the yield potential for rice has not increased since 1966 and the yield potential for maize has barely increased in 35 years
it takes a decade or two for herbicide resistant weeds to emerge and insects become resistant to insecticides within about a decade
crop rotation helps to prevent resistances
contemporary agriculture in the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides selective breeding mechanization water contamination and farm subsidies
proponents of organic farming such as sir albert howard argued in the early 20th century that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the long term fertility of the soil
while this feeling lay dormant for decades as environmental awareness has increased in the 21st century there has been a movement towards sustainable agriculture by some farmers consumers and policymakers
since the 1990s there has been a backlash against perceived external environmental effects of mainstream agriculture particularly regarding water pollution resulting in the organic movement
one of the major forces behind this movement has been the european union which first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its common agricultural policy cap in 2005 to phase out commodity linked farm subsidies also known as decoupling
the growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management and selective breeding
recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food
in late 2007 several factors pushed up the price of grains consumed by humans as well as used to feed poultry and dairy cows and other cattle causing higher prices of wheat up 58 soybean up 32 and maize up 11 over the year
contributing factors included increased demand for grain fed animal products from the growing middle classes of countries such as china and india and the diversion of food grain to biofuel production
food riot s took place in several countries across the world
the international fund for agricultural development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security
they in part base this on the experience of vietnam which went from a food importer to large food exporter and saw a significant drop in poverty due mainly to the development of smallholder agriculture in the country
an epidemic of stem rust on wheat caused by race ug99 is currently spreading across africa and into asia and is causing major concern
approximately 40 of the world s agricultural land is seriously degraded
in africa if current trends of soil degradation continue the continent might be able to feed just 25 of its population by 2025 according to unu s ghana based institute for natural resources in africa
in 2009 the agricultural output of china was the largest in the world followed by the european union india and the united states according to the international monetary fund see below
economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the united states is roughly 1 7 times more productive than it was in 1948
six countries – the us canada france australia argentina and thailand – supply 90 of grain exports
water deficits which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous middle sized countries including algeria iran egypt and mexico may soon do the same in larger countries such as china or india
as of 2011 the international labour organization states that approximately one billion people or over 1 3 of the available work force are employed in the global agricultural sector
agriculture constitutes approximately 70 percent of the global employment of children and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry
in 2007 the services sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest employer
between 1997 and 2007 the percentage of people employed in agriculture fell by over four percentage points a trend that is expected to continue
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a neutral forum where nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate food policy and the regulation of agriculture
according to dr samuel jutzi director of fao s animal production and health division lobbying by powerful big food corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment
the real true issues are not being addressed by the political process because of the influence of lobbyists of the true powerful entities he said speaking at the compassion in world farming annual forum
for example recent proposals for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health and environmental regulations such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long term damage were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure
agricultural safety agriculture remains a hazardous industry and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work related injuries lung disease noise induced hearing loss skin diseases as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure
on industrialized farms injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery
a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers which can be prevented by the use of roll over protection structures which limit the risk of injury in case a tractor rolls over
pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illnesses or birth defects
as an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself entire families can be at risk for injuries illness and death
common causes of fatal injuries among young farm worker include drowning machinery and motor vehicle related accidents
the international labour organization considers agriculture one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors
it estimates that the annual work related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170 000 twice the average rate of other jobs
in addition incidences of death injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported
the organization has developed the safety and health in agriculture convention 2001 which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play
agricultural production systems crop cultivations systems cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints geography and climate of the farm government policy economic social and political pressures and the philosophy and culture of the farmer
shifting cultivation or slash and burn is a system in which forests are burnt releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years
then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest and the farmer moves to a new plot returning after many more years 10 – 20
this fallow period is shortened if population density grows requiring the input of nutrients fertilizer or manure and some manual pest control
annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period
this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs
further industrialization lead to the use of monoculture s when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage
because of the low biodiversity nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up necessitating the greater use of pesticide s and fertilizers
multiple cropping in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year and intercropping when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polyculture s in subtropical and arid environments the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year or requiring irrigation
in all of these environments perennial crops are grown coffee chocolate and systems are practiced such as agroforestry
in temperate environments where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie highly productive annual cropping is the dominant farming system
the last century has seen the intensification concentration and specialization of agriculture relying upon new technologies of agricultural chemicals fertilizer s and pesticide s mechanization and plant breeding hybrids and gmo s
in the past few decades a move towards sustainability in agriculture has also developed integrating ideas of socio economic justice and conservation of resources and the environment within a farming system
this has led to the development of many responses to the conventional agriculture approach including organic agriculture urban agriculture community supported agriculture ecological or biological agriculture integrated farming and holistic management as well as an increased trend towards agricultural diversification
crop statisticsimportant categories of crops include grains and pseudograins pulses legumes forage and fruits and vegetables
specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing region s throughout the world
in millions of metric tons based on fao estimate
livestock production systems animals including horses mule s ox en camel s llama s alpaca s and dogs are often used to help cultivate fields harvest crops wrangle other animals and transport farm products to buyers
animal husbandry not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products like milk eggs or wool on a continual basis but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship
livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source as grassland – based mixed and landless
grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland rangeland and pastures for feeding ruminant animals
outside nutrient inputs may be used however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source
this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil representing 30 – 40 million pastoralists
mixed production systems use grassland fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastic one stomach mainly chickens and pigs livestock
manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops
approximately 68 of all agricultural land is permanent pastures used in the production of livestock
landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm representing the de linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in oecd member countries
in the u s 70 of the grain grown is fed to animals on feedlots
some of the practices used in commercial livestock production including the usage of growth hormone s are controversial
synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution
production practices tillage is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control
tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no till
it may improve productivity by warming the soil incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds but also renders soil more prone to erosion triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing co2 and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms
pest control includes the management of weeds insects mites and diseases
chemical pesticide s biological biocontrol mechanical tillage and cultural practices are used
cultural practices include crop rotation culling cover crop s intercropping composting avoidance and resistance
integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss and recommends pesticides as a last resort
nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production and the method of utilization of manure produced by livestock
nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers manure green manure compost and mined minerals
crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period
manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing such as in managed intensive rotational grazing or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pasture s water management is where rainfall is insufficient or variable which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world
some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall
in other areas such as the great plains in the u s and canada farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year
agriculture represents 70 of freshwater use worldwide
crop alteration and biotechnology crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years since the beginning of civilization
altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans for example larger fruits or seeds drought tolerance or resistance to pests
significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel
his work on dominant and recessive alleles gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and brought great insights to the techniques utilized by plant breeders
crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits self pollination and cross pollination and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism
domestication of plants has over the centuries increased yield improved disease resistance and drought tolerance eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants
careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants
plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture grasses and clover in new zealand
extensive x ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts i e primitive genetic engineering during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat corn maize and barley
the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield many folds by creating high yielding varieties
for example average yields of corn maize in the usa have increased from around 2 5 tons per hectare t ha 40 bushels per acre in 1900 to about 9 4 t ha 150 bushels per acre in 2001
similarly worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t ha in 1900 to more than 2 5 t ha in 1990
south american average wheat yields are around 2 t ha african under 1 t ha egypt and arabia up to 3 5 to 4 t ha with irrigation
in contrast the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over 8 t ha
variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate genetics and the level of intensive farming techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control growth control to avoid lodging
genetic engineering genetically modified organism s gmo are organism s whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology
genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops
increased durability nutritional content insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering
herbicide tolerant gmo crops roundup ready seed has a herbicide resistant gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to glyphosate
roundup is a trade name for a glyphosate based product which is a systemic nonselective herbicide used to kill weeds
roundup ready seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with glyphosate to control weeds without harming the resistant crop
herbicide tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide
today 92 of soybean acreage in the us is planted with genetically modified herbicide tolerant plants
with the increasing use of herbicide tolerant crops comes an increase in the use of glyphosate based herbicide sprays
in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides
some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications
insect resistant gmo crops other gmo crops used by growers include insect resistant crops which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt which produces a toxin specific to insects
these crops protect plants from damage by insects one such crop is starlink
another is cotton which accounts for 63 of us cotton acreage
some believe that similar or better pest resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross pollination with wild species
in some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance traits some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes
gmo regulation food security issues also coincide with food safety and food labeling concerns
currently a global treaty the biosafety protocol regulates the trade of gmos
the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled whereas the us does not require transparent labeling of gmo foods
since there are still questions regarding the safety and risks associated with gmo foods some believe the public should have the freedom to choose and know what they are eating and require all gmo products to be labeled
environmental impact agriculture imposes external costs upon society through pesticides nutrient runoff excessive water usage and assorted other problems
a 2000 assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for 1996 of £ 2 343 million or £ 208 per hectare
a 2005 analysis of these costs in the usa concluded that cropland imposes approximately 5 to 16 billion 30 to 96 per hectare while livestock production imposes 714 million
both studies concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs and neither included subsidies in their analysis but noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society
both focused on purely fiscal impacts
the 2000 review included reported pesticide poisonings but did not include speculative chronic effects of pesticides and the 2004 review relied on a 1992 estimate of the total impact of pesticides
in 2010 the international resource panel of the united nations environment programme published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production
the study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures particularly habitat change climate change water use and toxic emissions
agriculture accounts for 70 per cent of withdrawals of freshwater resources
however increasing pressure being placed on water resources by industry cities and the involving biofuels industry means that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world s growing population with fewer water resources
scientists are also realising that water resources need to be allocated to maintain natural environmental services such as protecting towns from flooding cleaning ecosystems and supporting fish stocks
in the book out of water from abundance to scarcity and how to solve the world s water problems authors colin chartres and samyukta varma of the international water management institute lay down a six point plan of action for addressing the global challenge of producing sufficient food for the world with dwindling water resources
one of the actions they say is required is to ensure all water systems such as lakes and rivers have water allocated to environmental flow
livestock issues a senior un official and co author of a un report detailing this problem henning steinfeld said livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today s most serious environmental problems
livestock production occupies 70 of all land used for agriculture or 30 of the land surface of the planet
it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases responsible for 18 of the world s greenhouse gas emissions as measured in co2 equivalents
by comparison all transportation emits 13 5 of the co2
it produces 65 of human related nitrous oxide which has 296 times the global warming potential of co2 and 37 of all human induced methane which is 23 times as warming as co2
it also generates 64 of the ammonia emission
livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation in the amazon basin 70 of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops
through deforestation and land degradation livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity
land transformation and degradation land transformation the use of land to yield goods and services is the most substantial way humans alter the earth s ecosystems and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity
estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 – 50
land degradation the long term decline in ecosystem function and productivity is estimated to be occurring on 24 of land worldwide with cropland overrepresented
the un fao report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 1 5 billion people rely upon the degrading land
degradation can be deforestation desertification soil erosion mineral depletion or chemical degradation acidification and salinization
eutrophication eutrophication excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystem s resulting in algal bloom s and anoxia leads to fish kill s loss of biodiversity and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses
excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient mainly nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and leaching from agricultural land
these nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems
pesticides pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2 5 million tons annually worldwide yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant
the world health organization estimated in 1992 that 3 million pesticide poisonings occur annually causing 220 000 deaths
pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide
an alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming a view exemplified by a quote heading the center for global food issues website growing more per acre leaves more land for nature
however critics argue that a trade off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation
climate change climate change has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature rainfall timing and quantity co2 solar radiation and the interaction of these elements
extreme events such as droughts and floods are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold
agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change water supply for example will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world s growing population
transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in future
for example policies practices and tools promoting climate smart agriculture will be important as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability
planners and policy makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation
agriculture can both mitigate or worsen global warming
some of the increase in co2 in the atmosphere comes from the decomposition of organic matter in the soil and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as rice paddies as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals
further wet or anaerobic soils also lose nitrogen through denitrification releasing the greenhouse gases nitric oxide and nitrous oxide
changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases and soil can further be used to sequester some of the co2 in the atmosphere
sustainability some major organisations are hailing farming within agroecosystems as the way forward for mainstream agriculture
current farming methods have resulted in over stretched water resources high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility
according to a report by the international water management institute and unep there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices therefore how we use critical water land and ecosystem resources to boost crop yields must be reconsidered
the report suggested that we need to assign value to ecosystems recognize environmental and livelihood tradeoffs and balance the rights of a variety of users and interests
we would also need to address inequities that result when such measures are adopted such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights
technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable
new technologies have given rise to innovations like conservation tillage a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration
agricultural economics agricultural economics relates to the production distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services
national government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products in the form of taxation subsidies tariffs and other measures
since at least the 1960s a combination of import export restrictions exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and developed world
in the 1980s it was clear that non subsidized farmers in developing countries were experiencing adverse affects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products
between the mid 1980s and the early 2000s several international agreements were put into place that limited agricultural tariffs subsidies and other trade restrictions
however as of 2009 there was still a significant amount of policy driven distortion in global agricultural product prices
the three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar milk and rice mainly due to taxation
among the oilseed s sesame had the greatest amount of taxation but overall feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products
since the 1980s policy driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy
despite this progress certain crops such as cotton still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices causing hardship in developing countries with non subsidized farmers
in the united states food costs attributed to food processing distribution and agricultural marketing have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined
this is related to the greater efficiency of farming combined with the increased level of value addition e g more highly processed products provided by the supply chain
from 1960 to 1980 the farm share was around 40 but by 1990 it had declined to 30 and by 1998 22 2
market concentration has increased in the sector as well with the top 20 food manufacturers accounting for half the food processing value in 1995 over double that produced in 1954
as of 2000 the top six us supermarket groups had 50 of sales compared to 32 in 1992
although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers farmers and consumers and may have negative implications for rural communities
list of countries by agricultural output below is a list of countries by agricultural output in 2011
energy and agriculture since the 1940s agricultural productivity has increased dramatically due largely to the increased use of energy intensive mechanization fertilizer s and pesticide s the vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources
between the 1960 – 65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 – 90 the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe with world grain production increasing significantly between 70 and 390 for wheat and 60 to 150 for rice depending on geographic area as world population doubled
modern agriculture s heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output causing food shortages
modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways 1 direct consumption on the farm and 2 indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm
direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery and use of gas liquid propane and electricity to power dryers pumps lights heaters and coolers
american farms directly consumed about 1 2 exajoules 1 1 quadrillion btu in 2002 or just over 1 percent of the nation s total energy
indirect consumption is mainly oil and natural gas used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides which accounted for 0 6 exajoules 0 6 quadrillion btu in 2002
the natural gas and coal consumed by the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage
china utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer while most of europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal
according to a 2010 report published by the royal society agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels
overall the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors including crop production system and location
the energy used to manufacture farm machinery is also a form of indirect agricultural energy consumption
together direct and indirect consumption by us farms accounts for about 2 percent of the nation s energy use
direct and indirect energy consumption by u s farms peaked in 1979 and has gradually declined over the past 30 years
food systems encompass not just agricultural production but also off farm processing packaging transporting marketing consumption and disposal of food and food related items
agriculture accounts for less than one fifth of food system energy use in the us
in 2007 higher incentives for farmers to grow non food biofuel crops combined with other factors such as overdevelopment of former farm lands rising transportation costs climate change growing consumer demand in china and india and population growth caused food shortages in asia the middle east africa and mexico as well as rising food prices around the globe
as of december 2007 37 countries faced food crises and 20 had imposed some sort of food price controls
some of these shortages resulted in food riots and even deadly stampedes
mitigation of effects of petroleum shortages in the event of a petroleum shortage see peak oil for global concerns organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum based pesticides herbicides or fertilizers
some studies using modern organic farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming
in the aftermath of the fall of the soviet union with shortages of conventional petroleum based inputs cuba made use of mostly organic practices including biopesticides plant based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices to feed its populace
however organic farming may be more labor intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas
the reconditioning of soil to restore nutrients lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques also takes time
it has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the biochar and synfuel process which uses agricultural waste to provide charcoal fertilizer some fuel and food instead of the normal food vs fuel debate
as the synfuel would be used on site the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic agriculture fusion
it has been suggested that some transgenic plants may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil fuel derived inputs than conventional crops
the possibility of success of these programs is questioned by ecologists and economists concerned with unsustainable gmo practices such as terminator seeds
while there has been some research on sustainability using gmo crops at least one prominent multi year attempt by monsanto company has been unsuccessful though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop
policy agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products
governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets
some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment including policies related to climate change food safety and natural disasters economic stability including policies related to taxes natural resources and environmental sustainability especially water policy research and development and market access for domestic commodities including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries
agricultural policy can also touch on food quality ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality food security ensuring that the food supply meets the population s needs and conservation
policy programs can range from financial programs such as subsidies to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs

aldous leonard huxley 26 july 1894 – 22 november 1963 was an english writer and one of the most prominent members of the famous huxley family
best known for his novels including brave new world and a wide ranging output of essays huxley also edited the magazine oxford poetry and published short stories poetry travel writing film stories and scripts
he spent the later part of his life in the united states living in los angeles from 1937 until his death
huxley was a humanist pacifist and satirist
he later became interested in spiritual subjects such as parapsychology and philosophical mysticism in particular vivekanda s neo vedanta and universalism
he is also well known for his advocacy and consumption of psychedelic drugs
by the end of his life huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the pre eminent intellectuals of his time
early life aldous huxley was born in godalming surrey england in 1894
he was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster leonard huxley and his first wife julia arnold who founded prior s field school
julia was the niece of poet and critic matthew arnold and the sister of mrs humphrey ward
aldous was the grandson of thomas henry huxley the zoologist agnostic and controversialist darwin s bulldog
his brother julian huxley and half brother andrew huxley also became outstanding biologists
aldous had another brother noel trevelyan huxley 1891 – 1914 who committed suicide after a period of clinical depression
huxley began his learning in his father s well equipped botanical laboratory then continued in a school named hillside
his teacher was his mother who supervised him for several years until she became terminally ill
after hillside he was educated at eton college
huxley s mother died in 1908 when he was 14
in 1911 he suffered an illness keratitis punctata which left him practically blind for two to three years
aldous near blindness disqualified him from service in the first world war
once his eyesight recovered sufficiently he was able to study english literature at balliol college oxford
in 1916 he edited oxford poetry and later graduated b a with first class honours
his brother julian wrote i believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise
for one thing it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career his uniqueness lay in his universalism
he was able to take all knowledge for his province
following his education at balliol huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living
he taught french for a year at eton where eric blair later to become george orwell and stephen runciman were among his pupils but was remembered as an incompetent and hopeless teacher who could n’t keep discipline
nevertheless blair and others were impressed by his use of words
for a short while in 1918 he was employed acquiring provisions at the air ministry
significantly huxley also worked for a time in the 1920s at the technologically advanced brunner and mond chemical plant in billingham teesside and the most recent introduction to his famous science fiction novel brave new world 1932 states that this experience of an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence was one source for the novel
career huxley completed his first unpublished novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early 20s
his first published novels were social satires beginning with crome yellow 1921
bloomsbury set during the first world war huxley spent much of his time at garsington manor home of lady ottoline morrell working as a farm labourer
here he met several bloomsbury figures including bertrand russell and clive bell
later in crome yellow 1921 he caricatured the garsington lifestyle
in 1919 he married maria nys a belgian woman he met at garsington they had one son
the family lived in italy part of the time in the 1920s where huxley would visit his friend d h lawrence
following lawrence s death in 1930 huxley edited lawrence s letters 1933
works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress most famously brave new world and on pacifist themes for example eyeless in gaza
in brave new world huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and pavlovian conditioning
huxley was strongly influenced by f matthias alexander and included him as a character in eyeless in gaza
starting from this period huxley began to write and edit non fiction works on pacifist issues including ends and means an encyclopedia of pacifism and pacifism and philosophy and was an active member of the peace pledge union
the u s
in 1937 huxley moved to hollywood with his wife maria son matthew and friend gerald heard
he lived in the u s mainly in southern california until his death but also for a time in taos new mexico where he wrote ends and means published in 1937
in this work he examines the fact that although most people in modern civilisation agree that they want a world of liberty peace justice and brotherly love they have not been able to agree on how to achieve it
heard introduced huxley to vedanta upanishad centered philosophy meditation and vegetarianism through the principle of ahimsa
in 1938 huxley befriended j krishnamurti whose teachings he greatly admired
he also became a vedantist in the circle of hindu swami prabhavananda and introduced christopher isherwood to this circle
not long after huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas the perennial philosophy which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world
huxley s book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted five senses and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities
huxley became a close friend of remsen bird president of occidental college
he spent much time at the college which is in the eagle rock neighbourhood of los angeles
the college appears as tarzana college in his satirical novel after many a summer 1939
the novel won huxley that year s james tait black memorial prize for fiction
huxley also incorporated bird into the novel
during this period huxley earned some hollywood income as a writer
in march 1938 his friend anita loos a novelist and screenwriter put him in touch with metro goldwyn mayer who hired huxley for madame curie which was originally to star greta garbo and be directed by george cukor
the film was eventually completed by mgm in 1943 with a different director and cast
huxley received screen credit for pride and prejudice 1940 and was paid for his work on a number of other films including jane eyre 1944
his experience in hollywood was not a success
when he wrote a synopsis of alice in wonderland walt disney rejected it on the grounds that he could only understand every third word
huxley s leisurely development of ideas it seemed was not suitable for the movie moguls who demanded fast dynamic dialogue above all else
for dick huemer during the 1940s huxley went to the first of a five meetings session to elaborate the script of alice in wonderland but never came again
for author john grant although the movie s character the caterpillar displays some characteristics familiar from huxley s discussion of his experiments with hallucinogens huxley s contribution to the movie is nonexistent
on 21 october 1949 huxley wrote to george orwell author of nineteen eighty four congratulating him on how fine and how profoundly important the book is
in his letter to orwell he predicted within the next generation i believe that the world s leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco hypnosis are more efficient as instruments of government than clubs and prisons and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience
huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself
from these he put forward some warnings in his writings and talks
in a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist mike wallace huxley outlined several major concerns the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organization the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well marketed commodities
post world war ii after the second world war huxley applied for united states citizenship
his application was continuously deferred on the grounds that he would not say he would take up arms to defend the u s
he claimed a philosophical rather than a religious objection and therefore was not exempt under the mccarran act
he withdrew his application
nevertheless he remained in the country and in 1959 he turned down an offer of a knight bachelor by the macmillan government
during the 1950s huxley s interest in the field of psychical research grew keener and his later works are strongly influenced by both mysticism and his experiences with psychedelic drug s in october 1930 the english occultist aleister crowley dined with huxley in berlin and to this day rumours persist that crowley introduced huxley to peyote on that occasion
he was introduced to mescaline the key active ingredient of peyote by the psychiatrist humphry osmond in 1953 taking for his first time during the evening of may 5
through dr osmond huxley met millionaire alfred matthew hubbard who would deal with lsd on a wholesale basis
on 24 december 1955 huxley took his first dose of lsd
indeed huxley was a pioneer of self directed psychedelic drug use in a search for enlightenment famously taking 100 micrograms of lsd as he lay dying
his psychedelic drug experiences are described in the essays the doors of perception the title deriving from some lines in the book the marriage of heaven and hell by william blake and heaven and hell
some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early hippies
while living in los angeles huxley was a friend of ray bradbury
according to sam weller s biography of bradbury the latter was dissatisfied with huxley especially after huxley encouraged bradbury to take psychedelic drugs
association with vedanta beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963 huxley had an extensive association with the vedanta society of southern california founded and headed by swami prabhavananda
together with gerald heard christopher isherwood and other followers he was initiated by the swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices
in 1944 huxley wrote the introduction to the bhagavad gita the song of god translated by swami prabhavanada and christopher isherwood which was published by the vedanta society of southern california
from 1941 through 1960 huxley contributed 48 articles to vedanta and the west published by the society
he also served on the editorial board with isherwood heard and playwright john van druten from 1951 through 1962
huxley also occasionally lectured at the hollywood and santa barbara vedanta temples
two of those lectures have been released on cd knowledge and understanding and who are we from 1955
after the publication of the doors of perception huxley and the swami disagreed about the meaning and importance of the lsd drug experience which may have caused the relationship to cool but huxley continued to write articles for the society s journal lecture at the temple and attend social functions
eyesight with respect to details about the true quality of huxley s eyesight at specific points in his life there are differing accounts
around 1939 huxley encountered the bates method for better eyesight and a teacher margaret corbett who was able to teach him in the method
in 1940 huxley relocated from hollywood to a ranchito in the high desert hamlet of llano california in northernmost los angeles county
huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the bates method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern american desert
he reported that for the first time in over 25 years he was able to read without glasses and without strain
he even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch
he wrote a book about his successes with the bates method the art of seeing which was published in 1942 us 1943 uk
it was from this period with the publication of the generally disputed theories contained in the latter book that a growing degree of popular controversy arose over the subject of huxley ’s eyesight
it was and to a noticeable extent still is widely held that for most of his life since the illness in his teens which left huxley nearly blind that his eyesight was exceedingly poor despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at oxford
for instance some ten years after publication of the art of seeing in 1952 bennett cerf was present when huxley spoke at a hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty then suddenly he faltered — and the disturbing truth became obvious
he was n t reading his address at all
he had learned it by heart
to refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes
when it was only an inch or so away he still could n t read it and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him
it was an agonising moment
on the other hand huxley s second wife laura archera huxley would later emphasise in her biographical account this timeless moment one of the great achievements of his life that of having regained his sight
after revealing a letter she wrote to the los angeles times disclaiming the label of huxley as a poor fellow who can hardly see by walter c alvarez she tempers this although i feel it was an injustice to treat aldous as though he were blind it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision
for instance although aldous did not wear glasses he would quite often use a magnifying lens
laura huxley proceeds to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to huxley s vision
her account in this respect is discernibly congruent with the following sample of huxley s own words from the art of seeing
the most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism or any part of the organism is that it is not constant but highly variable
nevertheless the topic of huxley ’s eyesight continues to endure similar significant controversy regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear
personal life he married maria nys 10 september 1899 – 12 february 1955 a belgian he met at garsington in 1919
they had one child matthew huxley 19 april 1920 – 10 february 2005 who had a career as an author anthropologist and prominent epidemiologist
in 1955 maria died of breast cancer
in 1956 he married laura archera 1911 – 2007 also an author
she wrote this timeless moment a biography of huxley
in 1960 aldous huxley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and in the years that followed with his health deteriorating he wrote the utopian novel island and gave lectures on human potentialities at the esalen institute which were fundamental to the forming of the human potential movement
despite his interest in spirituality and mysticism huxley called himself an agnostic
the most substantial collection of huxley s few remaining papers following the destruction of most in a fire is at the library of the university of california los angeles
some are also at the stanford university library
death on his deathbed unable to speak huxley made a written request to his wife laura for lsd 100 µg intramuscular
according to her account of his death in this timeless moment she obliged with an injection at 11 45 am and a second one a few hours later huxley died aged 69 at 5 20 pm on 22 november 1963
media coverage of huxley s passing was overshadowed by the assassination of president john f kennedy on the same day as was the death of the british author c s lewis who also died on 22 november
this coincidence was the inspiration for peter kreeft s book between heaven and hell a dialog somewhere beyond death with john f kennedy c s lewis aldous huxley
huxley s ashes were interred in the family grave at the watts cemetery home of the watts mortuary chapel in compton a village near guildford surrey england

algae or singular alga latin for seaweed are a very large and diverse group of simple typically autotrophic organisms ranging from unicellular to multicellular forms such as the giant kelps that grow to 65 meters in length
most are photosynthetic and simple because they lack the many distinct cell and organ types found in land plants
the largest and most complex marine forms are called seaweed s though the prokaryotic cyanobacteria are informally referred to as blue green algae this usage is incorrect since they are regarded as bacteria
the term algae is now restricted to eukaryotic organisms
all true algae therefore have a nucleus enclosed within a membrane and plastid s bound in one or more membranes
algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor although their plastids seem to have a single origin
diatoms are also examples of algae
algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction
algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the leaf like phyllids of bryophytes rhizoid s in nonvascular plants and the root s leaves and other organs that are found in tracheophyte s vascular plants
many are phototroph ic although some groups contain members that are mixotroph ic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy
some unicellular species rely entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus
nearly all algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria and so produce oxygen as a by product of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria
fossilized filamentous algae from the vindhya basin have been dated back to 1 6 to 1 7 billion years ago
etymology and study the singular alga is the latin word for a particular seaweed and retains that meaning in english
the etymology is obscure
although some speculate that it is related to latin algēre be cold there is no known reason to associate seaweed with temperature
a more likely source is alliga binding entwining
the ancient greek word for seaweed was φῦκος fūkos or phykos which could mean either the seaweed probably red algae or a red dye derived from it
the latinization fūcus meant primarily the cosmetic rouge
the etymology is uncertain but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the biblical פוך pūk paint if not that word itself a cosmetic eye shadow used by the ancient egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern mediterranean
it could be any color black red green blue
accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology depending on whether the greek or latin root is used
the name fucus appears in a number of taxa
classification while cyanobacteria have been traditionally considered algae recent works usually exclude them due to large differences such as the lack of membrane bound organelle s the presence of a single circular chromosome the presence of peptidoglycan in the cell walls and ribosome s different in size and content from those of the eukaryote s rather than in chloroplast s they conduct photosynthesis on specialized infolded cytoplasmic membranes called thylakoid membranes
therefore they differ significantly from algae despite occupying similar ecological niche s by modern definitions algae are eukaryotes and conduct photosynthesis within membrane bound organelles called chloroplasts
chloroplasts contain circular dna and are similar in structure to cyanobacteria presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial endosymbionts
the exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting different endosymbiotic events
the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae
their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right
many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic
some retain plastid s but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely
phylogeny based on plastid not nucleocytoplasmic genealogy w h harvey 1811 — 1866 was the first to divide algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation
this is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics
harvey s four divisions are red algae rhodophyta brown algae heteromontophyta green algae chlorophyta and diatomaceae
relationship to higher plants the first plants on earth probably evolved from shallow freshwater algae much like chara some 400 million years ago
these probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations and were probably filamentous
fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago
morphology a range of algal morphologies are exhibited and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common
the only groups to exhibit three dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns and some chlorophytes
apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups the florideophyte reds various browns and the charophytes
the form of charophytes is quite different to those of reds and browns because have distinct nodes separated by internode stems whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetail s occur at the nodes
conceptacle s are another polyphyletic trait they appear in the coralline algae and the hildenbrandiales as well as the browns
most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellate s or amoeboid s but colonial and non motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups
some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the life cycle of a species are in three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached with full tissue differentiation
these are the brown algae — some of which may reach 50 m in length kelp s — the red alga e and the green alga e the most complex forms are found among the green algae see charales and charophyta in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants
the point where these non algal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers a characteristic not found in the other alga groups
physiology many algae particularly members of the characeae have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes osmoregulation turgor regulation salt tolerance cytoplasmic streaming and the generation of action potentials
symbiotic algae some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms
in these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates organic substances to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells
the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae
examples are as follows
lichens lichen s are defined by the international association for lichenology to be an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure
the fungi or mycobionts are from the ascomycota with a few from the basidiomycota
they are not found alone in nature but when they began to associate is not known
one mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species rarely two from the green algae except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with the same species of cyanobacteria hence photobiont is the more accurate term
a photobiont may be associated with many specific mycobionts or live independently accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal species
the association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone they can be experimentally isolated
it is possible that the photobiont triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont
coral reefs coral reef s are accumulated from the calcareous exoskeleton s of marine invertebrate s of the order scleractinia stony coral s
as animals they metabolize sugar and oxygen to obtain energy for their cell building processes including secretion of the exoskeleton with water and carbon dioxide as byproducts
as the reef is the result of a favorable equilibrium between construction by the corals and destruction by marine erosion the rate at which metabolism can proceed determines the growth or deterioration of the reef
dinoflagellate s algal protist s are often endosymbiont s in the cells of marine invertebrates where they accelerate host cell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host
stony corals that are reef building corals hermatypic coral s require endosymbiotic algae from the genus symbiodinium to be in a healthy condition
the loss of symbiodinium from the host is known as coral bleaching a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef
sea sponges green algae live close to the surface of some sponges for example breadcrumb sponge halichondria panicea
the alga is thus protected from predators the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80 of sponge growth in some species
life cycle rhodophyta chlorophyta and heterokontophyta the three main algal phyla have life cycles which show tremendous variation with considerable complexity
in general there is an asexual phase where the seaweed s cells are diploid a sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes
asexual reproduction is advantageous in that it permits efficient population increases but less variation is possible
sexual reproduction allows more variation but is more costly
often there is no strict alternation between the sporophyte and also because there is often an asexual phase which could include the fragmentation of the thallus
numbers the algal collection of the us national herbarium located in the national museum of natural history consists of approximately 320 500 dried specimens which although not exhaustive no exhaustive collection exists gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species that number remains unknown
estimates vary widely
for example according to one standard textbook in the british isles the uk biodiversity steering group report estimated there to be 20000 algal species in the uk
another checklist reports only about 5000 species
regarding the difference of about 15000 species the text concludes it will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species regional and group estimates have been made as well and so on but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources these numbers have no more credibility than the british ones mentioned above
most estimates also omit microscopic algae such as phytoplankton
the most recent estimate suggests a total number of 72 500 algal species worldwide
distribution the topic of distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid 19th century ad
algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spore s analogously to the dispersal of plantae by seeds and spores
spores are everywhere in all parts of the earth the waters fresh and marine the atmosphere free floating and in precipitation or mixed with dust the humus and in other organisms such as humans
whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions of where the spore lands
the spores of fresh water algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers
the bodies of water into which they are transported are chemically selective
marine spores are spread by currents
ocean water is temperature selective resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces
to some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses
it is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as pacific algae or north sea algae
when they occur out of their localities it is usually possible to hypothesize a transport mechanism such as the hulls of ships
for example ulva reticulata and ulva fasciata travelled from the mainland to hawaii in this manner
mapping is possible for select species only there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns
for example clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there
on the other hand scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the difficulties of undertaking such studies
locations algae are prominent in bodies of water common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments such as on snow and on ice
seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters under however some have been recorded to a depth of
the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology
microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column phytoplankton provide the food base for most marine food chain s in very high densities algal bloom s these algae may discolor the water and outcompete poison or asphyxiate other life forms
algae are variously sensitive to different factors which has made them useful as biological indicators in the ballantine scale and its modification
uses agar agar a gelatin ous substance derived from red algae has a number of commercial uses
it is a good medium for bacteria
alginates between 100 000 and 170 000 wet tons of macrocystis are harvested annually in california for alginate extraction and abalone feed
energy source to be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from local policy on the long run biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels
here algae based fuels hold great promise directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass
the break even point for algae based biofuels is estimated to occur in about ten to fifteen years
fertilizer for centuries seaweed has been used as a fertilizer george owen of henllys writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in south wales this kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes where it heteth and rotteth and will have a strong and loathsome smell when being so rotten they cast on the land as they do their muck and thereof springeth good corn especially barley after spring tydes or great rigs of the sea they fetch it in sacks on horse backes and carie the same three four or five miles and cast it on the lande which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass
today algae are used by humans in many ways for example as fertilizer s soil conditioner s and livestock feed
aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds
algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places
maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner
nutrition naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food especially in asia
they provide many vitamins including a b1 b2 b6 niacin and c and are rich in iodine potassium iron magnesium and calcium
in addition commercially cultivated microalgae including both algae and cyanobacteria are marketed as nutritional supplements such as spirulina chlorella and the vitamin c supplement dunaliella high in beta carotene
algae are national foods of many nations china consumes more than 70 species including fat choy a cyanobacterium considered a vegetable japan over 20 species ireland dulse chile cochayuyo
laver is used to make laver bread in wales where it is known as bara lawr in korea gim in japan nori and aonori
it is also used along the west coast of north america from california to british columbia in hawaii and by the māori of new zealand
sea lettuce and badderlocks are a salad ingredient in scotland ireland greenland and iceland
the oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acid s for example parietochloris incisa is very high in arachidonic acid where it reaches up to 47 of the triglyceride pool
some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the long chain essential omega 3 fatty acid s docosahexaenoic acid dha and eicosapentaenoic acid epa
fish oil contains the omega 3 fatty acids but the original source is algae microalgae in particular which are eaten by marine life such as copepod s and are passed up the food chain
algae has emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega 3 fatty acids for vegetarians who can not get long chain epa and dha from other vegetarian sources such as flaxseed oil which only contains the short chain alpha linolenic acid ala
pollution control agricultural research service scientists found that 60 90 of nitrogen runoff and 70 100 of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using an algal turf scrubber ats
scientists developed the ats which are shallow 100 foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form and studied its efficacy for three years
they found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers streams and oceans
the enriched algae itself also can be used as a fertilizer
researchers collected and dried the nutrient rich algae from the ats and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer
they found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ats organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers
pigments the natural pigment s produced by algae can be used as an alternative to chemical dyes and coloring agents
stabilizing substances carrageenan from the red alga chondrus crispus is used as a stabilizer in milk products

analysis of variance anova is a collection of statistical model s used to analyze the differences between group means and their associated procedures such as variation among and between groups in which the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation
in its simplest form anova provides a statistical test of whether or not the mean s of several groups are all equal and therefore generalizes t test to more than two groups
doing multiple two sample t tests would result in an increased chance of committing a type i error
for this reason anovas are useful in comparing testing three or more means groups or variables for statistical significance
background and terminology anova is a particular form of statistical hypothesis testing heavily used in the analysis of experimental data
a statistical hypothesis test is a method of making decisions using data
a test result calculated from the null hypothesis and the sample is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance assuming the truth of the null hypothesis
a statistically significant result when a probability p value is less than a threshold significance level justifies the rejection of the null hypothesis
in the typical application of anova the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population
this implies that all treatments have the same effect perhaps none
rejecting the null hypothesis implies that different treatments result in altered effects
by construction hypothesis testing limits the rate of type i errors false positives leading to false scientific claims to a significance level
experimenters also wish to limit type ii errors false negatives resulting in missed scientific discoveries
the type ii error rate is a function of several things including sample size positively correlated with experiment cost significance level when the standard of proof is high the chances of overlooking a discovery are also high and effect size when the effect is obvious to the casual observer type ii error rates are low
the terminology of anova is largely from the statistical design of experiments
the experimenter adjusts factors and measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect
factors are assigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and blocking to ensure the validity of the results
blinding keeps the weighing impartial
responses show a variability that is partially the result of the effect and is partially random error
anova is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple purposes
as a consequence it is difficult to define concisely or precisely
classical anova for balanced data does three things at once in short anova is a statistical tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed data
additionally as a result anova has long enjoyed the status of being the most used some would say abused statistical technique in psychological research
anova is probably the most useful technique in the field of statistical inference
anova is difficult to teach particularly for complex experiments with split plot designs being notorious
in some cases the proper application of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognition followed by the consultation of a classic authoritative test
design of experiments terms condensed from the nist engineering statistics handbook section 5 7
a glossary of doe terminology
classes of models there are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance and these are outlined here
fixed effects models model 1 the fixed effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see if the response variable values change
this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole
random effects models model 2 random effects models are used when the treatments are not fixed
this occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population
because the levels themselves are random variables some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments a multi variable generalization of simple differences differ from the fixed effects model
mixed effects models model 3 a mixed effects model contains experimental factors of both fixed and random effects types with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types
example teaching experiments could be performed by a university department to find a good introductory textbook with each text considered a treatment
the fixed effects model would compare a list of candidate texts
the random effects model would determine whether important differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts
the mixed effects model would compare the fixed incumbent texts to randomly selected alternatives
defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive with competing definitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire
assumptions of anova the analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches the most common of which uses a linear model that relates the response to the treatments and blocks
even when the statistical model is nonlinear it can be approximated by a linear model for which an analysis of variance may be appropriate
textbook analysis using a normal distribution the analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a linear model which makes the following assumptions about the probability distribution of the responses the separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the errors are independently identically and normally distributed for fixed effects models that is that the errors varepsilon s are independent and randomization based analysis in a randomized controlled experiment the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units following the experimental protocol
this randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out
the objective random assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis following the ideas of c s peirce and ronald a fisher
this design based analysis was discussed and developed by francis j anscombe at rothamsted experimental station and by oscar kempthorne at iowa state university
kempthorne and his students make an assumption of unit treatment additivity which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and david r cox
unit treatment additivityin its simplest form the assumption of unit treatment additivity states that the observed response y from experimental unit i when receiving treatment j can be written as the sum of the unit s response y i and the treatment effect t j that is the assumption of unit treatment addivity implies that for every treatment j the jth treatment have exactly the same effect t j on every experiment unit
the assumption of unit treatment additivity usually can not be directly falsified according to cox and kempthorne
however many consequences of treatment unit additivity can be falsified
for a randomized experiment the assumption of unit treatment additivity implies that the variance is constant for all treatments
therefore by contraposition a necessary condition for unit treatment additivity is that the variance is constant
the use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design based inference that is standard in finite population survey sampling
derived linear modelkempthorne uses the randomization distribution and the assumption of unit treatment additivity to produce a derived linear model very similar to the textbook model discussed previously
the test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model according to approximation theorems and simulation studies
however there are differences
for example the randomization based analysis results in a small but strictly negative correlation between the observations
in the randomization based analysis there is no assumption of a normal distribution and certainly no assumption of independence
on the contrary the observations are dependent
the randomization based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time
since the randomization based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach
few statisticians object to model based analysis of balanced randomized experiments
statistical models for observational datahowever when applied to data from non randomized experiments or observational studies model based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization
for observational data the derivation of confidence intervals must use subjective models as emphasized by ronald a fisher and his followers
in practice the estimates of treatment effects from observational studies generally are often inconsistent
in practice statistical models and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public
summary of assumptions the normal model based anova analysis assumes the independence normality and homogeneity of the variances of the residuals
the randomization based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the variances of the residuals as a consequence of unit treatment additivity and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment
both these analyses require homoscedasticity as an assumption for the normal model analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization based analysis
however studies of processes that change variances rather than means called dispersion effects have been successfully conducted using anova
there are no necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality but the f test used for anova hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical limitations which are of continuing interest
problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions
the property of unit treatment additivity is not invariant under a change of scale so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit treatment additivity
if the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions then the statistician may specify in the protocol for the experiment or observational study that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance
also a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses which are believed to follow a multiplicative model
according to cauchy s functional equation theorem the logarithm is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition
characteristics of anova anova is used in the analysis of comparative experiments those in which only the difference in outcomes is of interest
the statistical significance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two variances
this ratio is independent of several possible alterations to the experimental observations adding a constant to all observations does not alter significance
multiplying all observations by a constant does not alter significance
so anova statistical significance results are independent of constant bias and scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations
in the era of mechanical calculation it was common to subtract a constant from all observations when equivalent to dropping leading digits to simplify data entry
this is an example of data coding
logic of anova the calculations of anova can be characterized as computing a number of means and variances dividing two variances and comparing the ratio to a handbook value to determine statistical significance
calculating a treatment effect is then trivial the effect of any treatment is estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the observations which receive the treatment and the general mean
partitioning of the sum of squares anova uses traditional standardized terminology
the definitional equation of sample variance is s 2 textstyle frac sum y i bar 2 where the divisor is called the degrees of freedom df the summation is called the sum of squares ss the result is called the mean square ms and the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean
anova estimates 3 sample variances a total variance based on all the observation deviations from the grand mean an error variance based on all the observation deviations from their appropriate treatment means and a treatment variance
the treatment variance is based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean the result being multiplied by the number of observations in each treatment to account for the difference between the variance of observations and the variance of means
if the null hypothesis is true all three variance estimates are equal within sampling error
the fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares ss into components related to the effects used in the model
for example the model for a simplified anova with one type of treatment at different levels
the number of degrees of freedom df can be partitioned in a similar way one of these components that for error specifies a chi squared distribution which describes the associated sum of squares while the same is true for treatments if there is no treatment effect
see also lack of fit sum of squares
the f test the f test is used for comparisons of the components of the total deviation
for example in one way or single factor anova statistical significance is tested for by comparing the f test statistic where ms is mean square i number of treatments and n t total number of cases to the f distribution with i 1 n t i degrees of freedom
using the f distribution is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled chi squared distribution
the expected value of f is 1 where n is the treatment sample size which is 1 for no treatment effect
as values of f increase above 1 the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis
two apparent experimental methods of increasing f are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls
the textbook method of concluding the hypothesis test is to compare the observed value of f with the critical value of f determined from tables
the critical value of f is a function of the numerator degrees of freedom the denominator degrees of freedom and the significance level α
if f ≥ fcritical numerator df denominator df α then reject the null hypothesis
the computer method calculates the probability p value of a value of f greater than or equal to the observed value
the null hypothesis is rejected if this probability is less than or equal to the significance level α
the two methods produce the same result
the anova f test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors maximizing power for a fixed significance level
to test the hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect the f test s p values closely approximate the permutation test s p value s the approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced
such permutation test s characterize tests with maximum power against all alternative hypotheses as observed by rosenbaum
the anova f – test of the null hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect is recommended as a practical test because of its robustness against many alternative distributions
extended logic anova consists of separable parts partitioning sources of variance and hypothesis testing can be used individually
anova is used to support other statistical tools
regression is first used to fit more complex models to data then anova is used to compare models with the objective of selecting simple r models that adequately describe the data
such models could be fit without any reference to anova but anova tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients
w e think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring multilevel models — not as an alternative to regression but as a tool for summarizing complex high dimensional inferences anova for a single factor the simplest experiment suitable for anova analysis is the completely randomized experiment with a single factor
more complex experiments with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include completely randomized blocks and latin squares and variants graeco latin squares etc
the more complex experiments share many of the complexities of multiple factors
a relatively complete discussion of the analysis models data summaries anova table of the completely randomized experiment is available
anova for multiple factors anova generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors
when the experiment includes observations at all combinations of levels of each factor it is termed factorial
factorial experiments are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the efficiency grows as the number of factors increases
consequently factorial designs are heavily used
the use of anova to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication
in a 3 way anova with factors x y and z the anova model includes terms for the main effects x y z and terms for interactions xy xz yz xyz
all terms require hypothesis tests
the proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance
fortunately experience says that high order interactions are rare
the ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple factor anova
testing one factor at a time hides interactions but produces apparently inconsistent experimental results
caution is advised when encountering interactions test interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond anova if interactions are found
texts vary in their recommendations regarding the continuation of the anova procedure after encountering an interaction
interactions complicate the interpretation of experimental data
neither the calculations of significance nor the estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value
a significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects
graphical methods are recommended to enhance understanding
regression is often useful
a lengthy discussion of interactions is available in cox 1958
some interactions can be removed by transformations while others can not
a variety of techniques are used with multiple factor anova to reduce expense
one technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication possibly no replication with support of analytical trickery and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically or practically insignificant
an experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications
worked numeric examples several fully worked numerical examples are available
a simple case uses one way a single factor analysis
a more complex case uses two way two factor analysis
associated analysis some analysis is required in support of the design of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses
because experimentation is iterative the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments
preparatory analysis the number of experimental units in the design of an experiment the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment
experimentation is often sequential
early experiments are often designed to provide mean unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error
later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude in this case the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power among other goals
reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology
provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions
the analysis which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards
besides the power analysis there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units
these include graphical methods based on limiting the probability of false negative errors graphical methods based on an expected variation increase above the residuals and methods based on achieving a desired confident interval
power analysis power analysis is often applied in the context of anova in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain anova design effect size in the population sample size and significance level
power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true
effect size several standardized measures of effect gauge the strength of the association between a predictor or set of predictors and the dependent variable
effect size estimates facilitate the comparison of findings in studies and across disciplines
a non standardized measure of effect size with meaningful units may be preferred for reporting purposes
η2 eta squared eta squared describes the ratio of variance explained in the dependent variable by a predictor while controlling for other predictors
eta squared is a biased estimator of the variance explained by the model in the population it estimates only the effect size in the sample
on average it overestimates the variance explained in the population
as the sample size gets larger the amount of bias gets smaller cohen 1992 suggests effect sizes for various indexes including ƒ where 0 1 is a small effect 0 25 is a medium effect and 0 4 is a large effect
he also offers a conversion table see cohen 1988 p 283 for eta squared η2 where 0 0099 constitutes a small effect 0 0588 a medium effect and 0 1379 a large effect
followup analysis it is always appropriate to carefully consider outliers
they have a disproportionate impact on statistical conclusions and are often the result of errors
model confirmationit is prudent to verify that the assumptions of anova have been met
residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity and gross normality
residuals should have the appearance of zero mean normal distribution noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and modeled data values
trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations
one rule of thumb if the largest standard deviation is less than twice the smallest standard deviation we can use methods based on the assumption of equal standard deviations and our results will still be approximately correct
follow up testsa statistically significant effect in anova is often followed up with one or more different follow up tests
this can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses
follow up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned a priori or post hoc
planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data
often one of the treatments is none so the treatment group can act as a control
dunnett s test a modification of the t test tests whether each of the other treatment groups has the same mean as the control
post hoc tests such as tukey s range test most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for type i errors
comparisons which are most commonly planned can be either simple or compound
simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean
compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups e g compare average group means of group a b and c with group d
comparisons can also look at tests of trend such as linear and quadratic relationships when the independent variable involves ordered levels
following anova with pair wise multiple comparison tests has been criticized on several grounds
there are many such tests 10 in one table and recommendations regarding their use are vague or conflicting
study designs and anovas there are several types of anova
many statisticians base anova on the design of the experiment especially on the protocol that specifies the random assignment of treatments to subjects the protocol s description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any blocking
it is also common to apply anova to observational data using an appropriate statistical model
some popular designs use the following types of anova anova cautions balanced experiments those with an equal sample size for each treatment are relatively easy to interpret unbalanced experiments offer more complexity
for single factor one way anova the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power
for more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications
the orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case
this means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply
consequently the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs
in the general case the analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data but then the sums of squares mean squares and f ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation are considered
the simplest techniques for handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data or by synthesizing missing data
more complex techniques use regression
anova is in part a significance test
the american psychological association holds the view that simply reporting significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred
while anova is conservative in maintaining a significance level against multiple comparisons in one dimension it is not conservative against comparisons in multiple dimensions
generalizations anova is considered to be a special case of linear regression which in turn is a special case of the general linear model
all consider the observations to be the sum of a model fit and a residual error to be minimized
the kruskal – wallis test and the friedman test are nonparametric tests which do not rely on an assumption of normality
history while the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century antecedents extend centuries into the past according to stigler
these include hypothesis testing the partitioning of sums of squares experimental techniques and the additive model
laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s
the development of least squares methods by laplace and gauss circa 1800 provided an improved method of combining observations over the existing practices of astronomy and geodesy
it also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares
laplace soon knew how to estimate a variance from a residual rather than a total sum of squares
by 1827 laplace was using least squares methods to address anova problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides
before 1800 astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting from reaction times the personal equation and had developed methods of reducing the errors
the experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology which developed strong full factorial experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added
an eloquent non mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was available in 1885
sir ronald fisher introduced the term variance and proposed a formal analysis of variance in a 1918 article the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance
his first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921
analysis of variance became widely known after being included in fisher s 1925 book statistical methods for research workers
randomization models were developed by several researchers
the first was published in polish by neyman in 1923
one of the attributes of anova which ensured its early popularity was computational elegance
the structure of the additive model allows solution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather than by matrix calculations
in the era of mechanical calculators this simplicity was critical
the determination of statistical significance also required access to tables of the f function which were supplied by early statistics texts

alkanes or paraffins a still used historical name for alkanes are saturated hydrocarbon s they consist only of hydrogen and carbon atoms all bonds are single bond s and the carbon atoms are not joined in cyclic structures but instead form a simple chain
they have the general chemical formula cnh2n 2
alkanes belong to a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ by a molecular mass of 14 one carbon atom of mass 12 and two hydrogen atoms of collective mass 2
there are two main commercial sources crude oil and natural gas
each carbon atom has 4 bonds either c h or c c bond s and each hydrogen atom is joined to a carbon atom h c bonds
a series of linked carbon atoms is known as the carbon skeleton or carbon backbone
the number of carbon atoms is used to define the size of the alkane e g c2 alkane
an alkyl group generally abbreviated with the symbol r is a functional group or side chain that like an alkane consists solely of single bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms for example a methyl or ethyl group
the simplest possible alkane the parent molecule is methane ch4
there is no limit to the number of carbon atoms that can be linked together the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic is saturated and is a hydrocarbon
saturated oils and waxes are examples of larger alkanes where the number of carbons in the carbon backbone is greater than 10
alkanes are not very reactive and have little biological activity
alkanes can be viewed as a molecular tree upon which can be hung the more biologically active reactive portions functional groups of the molecule
structure classification saturated hydrocarbons can be according to the definition by iupac the former two are alkanes whereas the third group is called cycloalkane s saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear cyclic e g polycyclic and branching structures and they are still alkanes no general formula as long as they are acyclic i e having no loops
they also have single covalent bonds between their carbons
isomerism alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various different ways forming structural isomer s the simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches
this isomer is sometimes called the n isomer n for normal although it is not necessarily the most common
however the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points
the number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms
for example branched alkanes can be chiral
for example 3 methylhexane and its higher homologues are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number 3
in addition to these isomers the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops
such compounds are called cycloalkane s nomenclature the iupac nomenclature systematic way of naming compounds for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains
unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix ane
in 1866 august wilhelm von hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a e i o and u to create suffixes ane ene ine or yne one une for the hydrocarbons cnh2n 2 cnh2n cnh2n 2 cnh2n 4 cnh2n 6
now the first three name hydrocarbons with single double and triple bonds one represents a ketone ol represents an alcohol or oh group oxy means an ether and refers to oxygen between two carbons so that methoxy methane is the iupac name for dimethyl ether
it is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one iupac name
this is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets
numbers in the name referring to which carbon a group is attached to should be as low as possible so that 1 is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side group
symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name
linear alkanes straight chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n for normal where a non linear isomer exists
although this is not strictly necessary the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight chain and branched chain isomers e g n hexane or 2 or 3 methylpentane
the members of the series in terms of number of carbon atoms are named as follows these names were derived from methanol ether propionic acid and butyric acid respectively
alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel a or o from the basic numerical term
hence pentane c5h12 hexane c6h14 heptane c7h16 octane c8h18 etc
the prefix is generally greek with the exceptions of nonane which has a latin prefix and undecane and tridecane which have mixed language prefixes
for a more complete list see list of alkanes
branched alkanes simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes for example n pentane isopentane and neopentane
iupac naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name
the key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows cyclic alkanes so called cyclic alkanes are in the technical sense not alkanes but cycloalkanes
they are hydrocarbons just like alkanes but contain one or more rings
simple cycloalkanes have a prefix cyclo to distinguish them from alkanes
cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms e g cyclopentane c5h10 is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like pentane c5h12 but they are joined up in a five membered ring
in a similar manner propane and cyclopropane butane and cyclobutane etc
substituted cycloalkanes are named similar to substituted alkanes — the cycloalkane ring is stated and the substituents are according to their position on the ring with the numbering decided by cahn ingold prelog rules
trivial names the trivial non systematic name for alkanes is paraffins
together alkanes are known as the paraffin series
trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts
they were coined before the development of systematic names and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry
cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes
it is almost certain that the term paraffin stems from the petrochemical industry
branched chain alkanes are called isoparaffins
the use of the term paraffin is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers i e compounds with the same chemical formula e g pentane and isopentane
the following trivial names are retained in the iupac system physical properties table of alkanes boiling point alkanes experience inter molecular van der waals force s stronger inter molecular van der waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes
there are two determinants for the strength of the van der waals forces under standard conditions from ch4 to c4h10 alkanes are gaseous from c5h12 to c17h36 they are liquids and after c18h38 they are solids
as the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size molecular weight of the molecule
as a rule of thumb the boiling point rises 20 – 30 ° c for each carbon added to the chain this rule applies to other homologous series
a straight chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact thus the greater van der waals forces between adjacent molecules
for example compare isobutane 2 methylpropane and n butane butane which boil at − 12 and 0 ° c and 2 2 dimethylbutane and 2 3 dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58 ° c respectively
for the latter case two molecules 2 3 dimethylbutane can lock into each other better than the cross shaped 2 2 dimethylbutane hence the greater van der waals forces
on the other hand cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules which give a plane of intermolecular contact
melting point the melting point s of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above
that is all other things being equal the larger the molecule the higher the melting point
there is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points
solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids
this rigid structure requires energy to break down
thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart
for alkanes this can be seen from the graph above i e the blue line
the odd numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes
this is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase forming a well organized structure which requires more energy to break apart
the odd number alkanes pack less well and so the looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart
the melting points of branched chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight chain alkanes again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase this is particularly true for isoalkanes 2 methyl isomers which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues
conductivity and solubility alkanes do not conduct electricity nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field
for this reason they do not form hydrogen bond s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water
since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order a reduction in entropy
as there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water alkanes are said to be hydrophobic in that they repel water
their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good a property that is called lipophilicity
different alkanes are for example miscible in all proportions among themselves
the density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water
hence alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane water mixture
molecular geometry the molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics
it is derived from the electron configuration of carbon which has four valence electron s the carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp3 hybridized that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals
these orbitals which have identical energies are arranged spatially in the form of a tetrahedron the angle of cos − 1 − ⅓ ≈ 109 47 ° between them
bond lengths and bond angles an alkane molecule has only c – h and c – c single bonds
the former result from the overlap of a sp ³ orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen the latter by the overlap of two sp ³ orbitals on different carbon atoms
the bond length s amount to 1 09 × 10 − 10 m for a c – h bond and 1 54 × 10 − 10 m for a c – c bond
the spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp ³ orbitals — they are tetrahedrally arranged with an angle of 109 47 ° between them
structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another while both common and useful do not correspond with the reality
conformation the structural formula and the bond angle s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule
there is a further degree of freedom for each carbon – carbon bond the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond
the spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation
ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes as there is only one c – c bond
if one looks down the axis of the c – c bond one will see the so called newman projection
the hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120 ° between them resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane
however the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0 ° and 360 °
this is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon – carbon single bond
despite this apparent freedom only two limiting conformations are important eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation
the two conformations also known as rotamer s differ in energy the staggered conformation is 12 6 kj mol lower in energy more stable than the eclipsed conformation the least stable
this difference in energy between the two conformations known as the torsion energy is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature
there is constant rotation about the c c bond
the time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next equivalent to the rotation of one ch3 group by 120 ° relative to the other is of the order of 10 − 11 seconds
the case of higher alkanes is more complex but based on similar principles with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon carbon bond
for this reason alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models
the actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules alkane molecules have no fixed structural form whatever the models may suggest
spectroscopic properties virtually all organic compounds contain carbon – carbon and carbon – hydrogen bonds and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra
alkanes are notable for having no other groups and therefore for the absence of other characteristic spectroscopic features
infrared spectroscopythe carbon – hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960 cm − 1 while the carbon – carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300 cm − 1
the carbon – hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at 1450 cm − 1 and 1375 cm − 1 while methylene groups show bands at 1465 cm − 1 and 1450 cm − 1
carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725 cm − 1
nmr spectroscopythe proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at δh 0 5 – 1 5
the carbon 13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon δc 8 – 30 primary methyl ch3 15 – 55 secondary methylene ch2 20 – 60 tertiary methyne c h and quaternary
the carbon 13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak due to the lack of nuclear overhauser effect and the long relaxation time and can be missed in weak samples or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time
mass spectrometryalkanes have a high ionization energy and the molecular ion is usually weak
the fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret but in the case of branched chain alkanes the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radical s the fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group m − 15 is often absent and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units corresponding to sequential loss of ch2 groups
chemical properties alkanes are only weakly reactive with ionic and other polar substances
the acid dissociation constant pka values of all alkanes are above 60 hence they are practically inert to acids and bases see carbon acid s
this inertness is the source of the term paraffins with the meaning here of lacking affinity
in crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years
however redox reactions of alkanes in particular with oxygen and the halogens are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition in the case of methane the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon − 4 is reached
reaction with oxygen if present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction stoichiometry leads to combustion without any smoke producing carbon dioxide and water
free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens leading to the production of haloalkanes
in addition alkanes have been shown to interact with and bind to certain transition metal complexes in see carbon hydrogen bond activation
free radical s molecules with unpaired electrons play a large role in most reactions of alkanes such as cracking and reformation where long chain alkanes are converted into shorter chain alkanes and straight chain alkanes into branched chain isomers
in highly branched alkanes the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value 109 5 ° in order to allow the different groups sufficient space
this causes a tension in the molecule known as steric hindrance and can substantially increase the reactivity
reactions with oxygen combustion reaction all alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases
the general equation for complete combustion is or cnh2n 2 3n 1 2 o2 → n 1 h2o nco2 in the absence of sufficient oxygen carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed as shown below for example methane see the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data
the standard enthalpy change of combustion δcho for alkanes increases by about 650 kj mol per ch2 group
branched chain alkanes have lower values of δcho than straight chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable
reactions with halogens alkanes react with halogen s in a so called free radical halogenation reaction
the hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms
free radical s are the reactive species that participate in the reaction which usually leads to a mixture of products
the reaction is highly exothermic and can lead to an explosion
these reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons
there are three steps experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction
the mixture produced however is not a statistical mixture secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free radicals
an example can be seen in the monobromination of propane in the figure below the statistical distribution should be 25 and 75 cracking cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones
this can be done with a thermal or catalytic method
the thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of free radical s the catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalyst s usually solid acids such as silica alumina and zeolite s which promote a heterolytic asymmetric breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ion s of opposite charges usually a carbo cation and the very unstable hydride anion
carbon localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement c c scission in position beta i e cracking and intra and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer
in both types of processes the corresponding reactive intermediate s radicals ions are permanently regenerated and thus they proceed by a self propagating chain mechanism
the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination
isomerization and reformation dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes
isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a platinum catalyst
in isomerization the alkanes become branched chain isomers
in other words it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens keeping the same molecular weight
in reformation the alkanes become cycloalkane s or aromatic hydrocarbon s giving off hydrogen as a by product
both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance
butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers
other reactions alkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen
alkanes can be chlorosulfonated and nitrated although both reactions require special conditions
the fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acid s is of some technical importance
in the reed reaction sulfur dioxide chlorine and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides
nucleophilic abstraction can be used to separate an alkane from a metal
alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by transmetalation reactions
occurrence occurrence of alkanes in the universe alkanes form a small portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets such as jupiter 0 1 methane 0 0002 ethane saturn 0 2 methane 0 0005 ethane uranus 1 99 methane 0 00025 ethane and neptune 1 5 methane 1 5 ppm ethane
titan 1 6 methane a satellite of saturn was examined by the huygens probe which indicated that titan s atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moon s surface
also on titan a methane spewing volcano was spotted and this volcanism is believed to be a significant source of the methane in the atmosphere
there also appear to be methane ethane lakes near the north polar regions of titan as discovered by cassini s radar imaging
methane and ethane have also been detected in the tail of the comet hyakutake
chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space away from the sun which would have evaporated these volatile molecules
alkanes have also been detected in meteorite s such as carbonaceous chondrite s occurrence of alkanes on earth traces of methane gas about 0 0002 or 1745 ppb occur in the earth s atmosphere produced primarily by methanogenic microorganisms such as archaea in the gut of ruminants
the most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and oil
natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane with some propane and butane oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons
these hydrocarbons were formed when dead marine animals and plants zooplankton and phytoplankton died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form
natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction these hydrocarbon deposits collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks comprise commercial oil fields
they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted can not be readily replaced
the depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisis
methane is also present in what is called biogas produced by animals and decaying matter which is a possible renewable energy source
alkanes have a low solubility in water so the content in the oceans is negligible however at high pressures and low temperatures such as at the bottom of the oceans methane can co crystallize with water to form a solid methane clathrate methane hydrate
although this can not be commercially exploited at the present time the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together
methane extracted from methane clathrate is therefore a candidate for future fuels
biological occurrence although alkanes occur in nature in various way they do not rank biologically among the essential materials
cycloalkanes with 14 to 18 carbon atoms occur in musk extracted from deer of the family moschidae
all further information refers to acyclic alkanes
certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes they prefer even numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd numbered chains
on the other hand certain archaea the methanogen s produce large quantities of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidized organic compounds
the energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen methanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year — the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them
the methane output of cattle and other herbivore s which can release up to 150 liters per day and of termite s is also due to methanogens
they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestine s of humans
methanogenic archaea are hence at the end of the carbon cycle with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis
it is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way
alkanes also play a role if a minor role in the biology of the three eukaryotic groups of organisms fungi plants and animals
some specialized yeasts e g candida tropicale pichia sp rhodotorula sp can use alkanes as a source of carbon and or energy
the fungus amorphotheca resinae prefers the longer chain alkanes in aviation fuel and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions
in plants the solid long chain alkanes are found in the plant cuticle and epicuticular wax of many species but are only rarely major constituents
they protect the plant against water loss prevent the leaching of important minerals by the rain and protect against bacteria fungi and harmful insects
the carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd numbered between twenty seven and thirty three carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by decarboxylation of even numbered fatty acid s the exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions temperature or humidity
more volatile short chain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues
the jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of n heptane in its resin for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating
floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components and n nonane is a significant component in the scent of some rose s emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane pentane and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels though they are not generally considered to be a major component of biogenic air pollution
edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers mainly 8 to 35 usually peaking in the low to upper 20s with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram parts per million by weight and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction
alkanes are found in animal products although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons
one example is the shark liver oil which is approximately 14 pristane 2 6 10 14 tetramethylpentadecane c19h40
they are important as pheromone s chemical messenger materials on which insects depend for communication
in some species e g the support beetle xylotrechus colonus pentacosane c25h52 3 methylpentaicosane c26h54 and 9 methylpentaicosane c26h54 are transferred by body contact
with others like the tsetse fly glossina morsitans morsitans the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2 methylheptadecane c18h38 17 21 dimethylheptatriacontane c39h80 15 19 dimethylheptatriacontane c39h80 and 15 19 23 trimethylheptatriacontane c40h82 and acts by smell over longer distances
waggle dancing honey bee s produce and release two alkanes tricosane and pentacosane
ecological relations one example in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role is the ecological relationship between the sand bee andrena nigroaenea and the early spider orchid ophrys sphegodes the latter is dependent for pollination on the former
sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate in the case of a nigroaenea the females emit a mixture of tricosane c23h48 pentacosane c25h52 and heptacosane c27h56 in the ratio 3 3 1 and males are attracted by specifically this odor
the orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees
as a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms
production petroleum refining as stated earlier the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and crude oil
alkanes are separated in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many different products
fischer tropsch the fischer tropsch process is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons including alkanes from carbon monoxide and hydrogen
this method is used to produce substitutes for petroleum distillates
laboratory preparation there is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory since they are usually commercially available
also alkanes are generally non reactive chemically or biologically and do not undergo functional group interconversion s cleanly
when alkanes are produced in the laboratory it is often a side product of a reaction
for example the use of n butyllithium as a strong base gives the conjugate acid n butane as a side product however at times it may be desirable to make a portion of a molecule into an alkane like functionality alkyl group using the above or similar methods
for example an ethyl group is an alkyl group when this is attached to a hydroxy group it gives ethanol which is not an alkane
to do so the best known methods are hydrogenation of alkene s alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from alkyl halide s in the corey house posner whitesides reaction
the barton mccombie deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols e g and the clemmensen reduction removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or alkyl substituted compounds e g applications the applications of a certain alkane can be determined quite well according to the number of carbon atoms
the first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes and in some countries for electricity generation
methane and ethane are the main components of natural gas they are normally stored as gases under pressure
it is however easier to transport them as liquids this requires both compression and cooling of the gas
propane and butane can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are well known as liquified petroleum gas lpg
propane for example is used in the propane gas burner and as a fuel for cars butane in disposable cigarette lighters
the two alkanes are used as propellants in aerosol spray s from pentane to octane the alkanes are reasonably volatile liquids
they are used as fuels in internal combustion engine s as they vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the uniformity of the combustion
branched chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes knocking than their straight chain homologues
this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of the fuel where 2 2 4 trimethylpentane isooctane has an arbitrary value of 100 and heptane has a value of zero
apart from their use as fuels the middle alkanes are also good solvent s for nonpolar substances
alkanes from nonane to for instance hexadecane an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms are liquids of higher viscosity less and less suitable for use in gasoline
they form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel
diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number cetane being an old name for hexadecane
however the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly
alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil
in the latter function they work at the same time as anti corrosive agents as their hydrophobic nature means that water can not reach the metal surface
many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax for example in candle s this should not be confused however with true wax which consists primarily of ester s alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen used for example in road surfacing
however the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking
some synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene are alkanes with chains containing hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms
these materials are used in innumerable applications and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year
environmental transformations when released in the environment alkanes do n t undergo rapid biodegradation because they have no functional groups like hydroxyl or carbonyl that are needed by most organisms in order to metabolize the compound
however some bacteria can metabolize some alkanes especially those linear and short by oxidizing the terminal carbon atom
the product is an alcohol that could be next oxidized to an aldehyde and finally to a carboxylic acid
the resulting fatty acid could be metabolized through the fatty acid degradation pathway
hazards methane is explosive when mixed with air 1 – 8 ch4
other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air
the lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain
pentane hexane heptane and octane are classed as dangerous for the environment and harmful
the straight chain isomer of hexane is a neurotoxin

in united states appellate procedure an appeal is a petition for review of a case that has been decided by a court of law
the petition is made to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court s decision
the specific procedures for appealing including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision can vary greatly from state to state
the right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state for example the new jersey constitution vests judicial power in a supreme court a superior court and other courts of limited jurisdiction with an appellate court being part of the superior court
the nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted
there are many types of standard of review for appeals such as de novo and abuse of discretion
an appellate court is a court that hears cases on appeal from another court
depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance a party to a court case who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds
these grounds typically could include errors of law fact procedure or due process
in different jurisdictions appellate courts are also called appeals courts courts of appeals superior courts or supreme courts
access to appellant status a party who files an appeal is called an appellant plaintiff in error petitioner or pursuer and a party on the other side is called a appellee
a cross appeal is an appeal brought by the respondent
for example suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay 50 000
if the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money then the plaintiff might file a cross appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay 200 000 instead of 50 000
the appellant is the party who having lost part or all their claim in a lower court decision is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered
this is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence
the appellant in the new case can be either the plaintiff or claimant defendant third party intervenor or respondent appellee from the lower case depending on who was the losing party
the winning party from the lower court however is now the respondent
in unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below but still appeal
an appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court judgment was in its favor
the appellee is required to respond to the petition oral argument s and legal brief s of the appellant
in general the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower court s decision should be affirmed
ability to appeal an appeal as of right is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle
the appellate court can not refuse to listen to the appeal
an appeal by leave or permission requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the appellate court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant s demand to appeal the lower court s decision
in the supreme court review in most cases is available only if the court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari
in tort equity or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal
in criminal matters however the state or prosecution generally has no appeal as of right
and due to the double jeopardy principle the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal
but in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal as of right from a trial court s dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court s granting of a defendant s suppression motion
likewise in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law by leave from the trial court and or the appellate court
the ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally
all parties must present grounds to appeal or it will not be heard
by convention in some law reports the appellant is named first
this can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals the name of the case in the law reports reverses in some cases twice as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy
this is not always true however
in the federal courts the parties names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the circuit courts of appeals and are re ordered only if the appeal reaches the supreme court
direct or collateral appealing criminal convictions many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals particularly in the criminal context
the first is the traditional direct appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review
the second is the collateral appeal or post conviction petition in which the petitioner appellant files the appeal in a court of first instance — usually the court that tried the case
the key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts and the latter in federal courts
relief in post conviction is rare and is most often found in capital or violent felony cases
the typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating dna evidence demonstrating the defendant s actual innocence
appellate review appellate review is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate jurisdiction take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts
it is distinguished from judicial review which refers to the court s overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons which may vary by jurisdiction
in most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final judgment
generally an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case
this is because such orders can not be appealed as of right
however certain critical interlocutory court order s such as the denial of a request for an interim injunction or an order holding a person in contempt of court can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of
there are two distinct forms of appellate review direct and collateral
for example a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court and lose on direct appeal to higher state appellate courts and if unsuccessful mount a collateral action such as filing for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts
generally speaking d irect appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact
collateral review on the other hand provide s an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional jurisdictional or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial

in anglo american common law courts appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by prerogative writ in certain cases
there is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental civil law legal systems though some mixed systems such as quebec recognize these prerogative writs
direct appealafter exhausting the first appeal as of right defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision
this appeal is known as a direct appeal
the highest state court generally known as the supreme court exercises discretion over whether it will review the case
on direct appeal a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process
preservation issuesan appellant s claim s must usually be preserved at trial
this means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial
because constitutional claims are of great magnitude appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved
for example connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims 1
the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error 2
the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right 3
the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial 4
if subject to harmless error analysis the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt
state post conviction relief collateral appealall states have a post conviction relief process
similar to federal post conviction relief an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review
typical claims might include ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence based on new evidence
these proceedings are separate from the direct appeal
as such the conviction is considered final
an appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal
that is it goes to the intermediate appellate court followed by the highest court
if the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration the sentence could be modified or a new trial could be ordered
habeas corpus notice of appeal a notice of appeal is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal
the form is completed by the appellant or by the appellant s legal representative
the nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country
the specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun
for example the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court or with the court from which the appeal is taken or both
some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the court s own web site
in new jersey for example the administrative office of the court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used
the deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short traditionally it is measured in days not months
this can vary from country to country as well as within a country depending on the specific rules in force
in the u s federal court system criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed or the right to appeal is forfeited
see also appellate procedure generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not
the appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court s findings of fact such as whether a defendant committed a particular act unless clearly erroneous and so will focus on the court s application of the law to those facts such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue
if the appellate court finds no defect it affirms the judgment
if the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision below i e in the lower court it may modify the ruling to correct the defect or it may nullify reverse or vacate the whole decision or any part of it
it may in addition send the case back remand or remit to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect
in some cases an appellate court may review a lower court decision de novo or completely challenging even the lower court s findings of fact
this might be the proper standard of review for example if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre trial motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony
another situation is where appeal is by way of re hearing
certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court
sometimes the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below
this would happen for example if the appellant waited too long under the appellate court s rules to file the appeal
generally there is no trial in an appellate court only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed — unless the appeal is by way of re hearing new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in very rare instances for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as prosecutorial misconduct
in some systems an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal
in other systems the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court
in those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court
the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee or respondent can present arguments against it
arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers if represented or pro se if the party has not engaged legal representation
those arguments are presented in written briefs and sometimes in oral argument to the court at a hearing
at such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs
in an adversarial system appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it
therefore if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner or against legal precedent that judgment will stand if not appealed – even if it might have been overturned on appeal
the united states legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals a trial de novo or an appeal on the record
a trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial trial
if unchallenged these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all
if a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal one generally has the power to request a trial de novo by a court of record
in such a proceeding all issues and evidence may be developed newly as though never heard before and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding
sometimes however the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence thus helping to curb frivolous appeals
in some cases an application for trial de novo effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place
the supreme court of virginia has stated that this court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial
the only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses where they are convicted on a lesser offense the appeal is of the lesser offense the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses
a trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles subject only to the limitation that conviction in the district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesser included offense
in an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal
each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result
precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments
in order for the appeal to succeed the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error that is an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly
some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney admitting or excluding evidence improperly acting outside the court s jurisdiction injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so juror misconduct etc
the failure to formally object at the time to what one views as improper action in the lower court may result in the affirmance of the lower court s judgment on the grounds that one did not preserve the issue for appeal by objecting
in cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact an appellate court will apply an abuse of discretion standard of review
under this standard the appellate court gives deference to the lower court s view of the evidence and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion
this is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness
on the other hand the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court s decision on issues of law and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard
in some cases an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered
in the case of new evidence there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial
another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel
if a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation he is entitled to a new trial
a lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words may it please the court
after an appeal is heard the mandate is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal this notice is transmitted to the trial court and when filed by the clerk of the trial court constitutes the final judgment on the case unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court
the mandate is distinguished from the appeal court s opinion which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision
in some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the remittitur
results the result of an appeal can be there can be multiple outcomes so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings reverse others and remand the case all at the same time
remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case
generally speaking an appellate court s judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed setting out with specificity the court s determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed reversed remanded or modified
some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than review improvidently granted
in other words after looking at the case they chose not to say anything
the result for the case of review improvidently granted is effectively the same as affirmed but without that extra higher court stamp of approval
generally an answer is a reply to a question or is a solution a retaliation or a response that is relevant to the said question
in law an answer was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something and thus generally any counter statement or defense a reply to a question or response or objection or a correct solution of a problem
in the common law an answer is the first pleading by a defendant usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant
it may have been preceded by an optional pre answer motion to dismiss or demurrer if such a motion is unsuccessful the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment
in a criminal case there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court
the pleading in the criminal case which is entered on the record in open court is usually either guilt y or not guilty
generally speaking in private civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence
there is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of equitable remedy such as restitution or a permanent injunction
criminal cases may lead to fine s or other punishment such as imprisonment
the famous latin responsa prudentium answers of the learned ones were the accumulated views of many successive generations of roman lawyer s a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative
in music an answer also known as countersubject is the technical name in counterpoint for the repetition or modification by one part or instrument of a theme proposed by another

an appellate court commonly called an appeals court or court of appeals american english or appeal court british english or court of second instance or second instance court is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal
in most jurisdiction s the court system is divided into at least three levels the trial court which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case at least one intermediate appellate court and a supreme court or court of last resort which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts
a jurisdiction s supreme court is that jurisdiction s highest appellate court
appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules
the authority of appellate courts to review decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another
in some places the appellate court has limited powers of review
generally speaking an appellate court s judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed setting out with specificity the court s determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed reversed remanded or modified
united states in the united states both state and federal appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were
furthermore u s appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court
hence such an appellate court will not consider an appellant s argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal
in most u s states and in u s federal courts parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right
this means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome
however appeals may be costly and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict
therefore only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals
some appellate courts particularly supreme courts have the power of discretionary review meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case
institutional titles many u s jurisdictions title their appellate court a court of appeal or court of appeals
historically others have titled their appellate court a court of errors or court of errors and appeals on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts
examples of such courts include the new jersey court of errors and appeals which existed from 1844 to 1947 the connecticut supreme court of errors which has been renamed the connecticut supreme court the kentucky court of errors renamed the kentucky supreme court and the mississippi high court of errors and appeals since renamed the supreme court of mississippi
in some jurisdictions courts able to hear appeals are known as an appellate division
the phrase court of appeals most often refers to intermediate appellate courts
however the new york system is different the new york court of appeals is the highest appellate court and the phrase new york supreme court applies to the trial court of general jurisdiction
depending on the system certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction
some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts such as the texas court of criminal appeals which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases and the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases on one hand and appeals from the court of federal claims on the other

arraignment is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant to inform the defendant of the charges against him or her
in response to arraignment the accused is expected to enter a plea
acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions but they generally include guilty not guilty and the peremptory pleas or pleas in bar setting out reasons why a trial can not proceed
pleas of nolo contendere no contest and the alford plea are allowed in some circumstances
in england wales northern ireland and australia arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment
the defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge
in federal courts of the united states arraignment takes place in two stages
the first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual s arrest 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until monday
during this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel
the presiding judge also decides at what amount if any to set bail
during the second arraignment a post indictment arraignment or pia the defendant is allowed to enter a plea
form of the arraignment the wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction
however it generally conforms with the following principles video arraignment video arraignment is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of videoconferencing technology
use of video arraignment system allows the court s to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the courtroom by using an audio visual link between the location where the offender is being held and the courtroom
use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport offenders
the transportation of offenders requires time puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public court personnel and for the security of the offender population
it also addresses the rising costs of transportation
guilty and not guilty pleas if the defendant pleads guilty an evidentiary hearing usually follows
the court is not required to accept a guilty plea
during the hearing the judge assesses the offense the mitigating factor s and the defendant s character and passes sentence
if the defendant pleads not guilty a date is set for a preliminary hearing or a trial
in the past a defendant who refused to plead or stood mute was subject to peine forte et dure law french for strong and hard punishment
today in common law jurisdictions the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea
the rationale for this is the defendant s right to silence
pre trial release this is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre trial release and bail may be made depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction
united states federal rules of criminal procedure under the federal rules of criminal procedure arraignment shall consist of an open reading of the indictment to the defendant and call on him to plead thereto
he she shall be given a copy of the indictment before he she is called upon to plead
america the beautiful is an american patriotic song
the lyrics were written by katharine lee bates and the music was composed by church organist and choirmaster samuel a ward
bates originally wrote the words as a poem pikes peak first published in the fourth of july edition of the church periodical the congregationalist in 1895
at that time the poem was titled america for publication
ward had originally written the music materna for the hymn o mother dear jerusalem in 1882 though it was not first published until 1892
ward s music combined with the bates poem was first published in 1910 and titled america the beautiful
the song is one of the most popular of the many american patriotic songs
history in 1893 at the age of thirty three bates an english professor at wellesley college had taken a train trip to colorado springs colorado to teach a short summer school session at colorado college
several of the sights on her trip inspired her and they found their way into her poem including the world s columbian exposition in chicago the white city with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings the wheat fields of america s heartland kansas through which her train was riding on july 16 and the majestic view of the great plains from high atop zebulon s pikes peak
on the pinnacle of that mountain the words of the poem started to come to her and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original antlers hotel
the poem was initially published two years later in the congregationalist to commemorate the fourth of july
it quickly caught the public s fancy
amended versions were published in 1904 and 1913
several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem
a hymn tune composed by samuel a ward was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today
just as bates had been inspired to write her poem ward too was inspired to compose his tune
the tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from coney island back to his home in new york city after a leisurely summer day in 1882 and he immediately wrote it down
he was so anxious to capture the tune in his head he asked fellow passenger friend harry martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on
he composed the tune for the old hymn o mother dear jerusalem retitling the work materna
ward s music combined with bates poem were first published together in 1910 and titled america the beautiful
ward died in 1903 not knowing the national stature his music would attain as the music was only first applied to the song in 1904
bates was more fortunate as the song s popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929
at various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song was written particularly during the john f kennedy administration there have been efforts to give america the beautiful legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to or in place of the star spangled banner but so far this has not succeeded
proponents prefer america the beautiful for various reasons saying it is easier to sing more melodic and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as the star spangled banner
some prefer america the beautiful over the star spangled banner due to the latter s war oriented imagery
others prefer the star spangled banner for the same reason
while that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem america the beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of americans
the melody of this song was the school song of the former university university of shanghai which closed in 1952
currently it is used by shanghai alumni primary school in hong kong and hujiang high school in taiwan as the melody of their school song
when richard nixon visited china in 1972 this song was played as the welcome music
this song was used as the background music of the television broadcast of the tiangong 1 launch
the song is often included in songbooks in a wide variety of religious congregations in the united states
lyrics original poem 1893 popular versions possibly the most notable current version of america the beautiful is the setting for band and symphonic orchestra by the late arranger conductor composer carmen dragon
performed thousands of times in recent years mr dragon s arrangement has been played for state occasions such as the memorial services for presidents ford and reagan and at tribute concerts for events such as the oklahoma city bombing and 9 11
three different renditions of the song have entered the hot country songs charts
the first was by charlie rich which went to number 22 in 1976
a second by mickey newbury peaked at number 82 in 1980
an all star version of america the beautiful performed by country singers trace adkins billy dean vince gill carolyn dawn johnson toby keith brenda lee lonestar martina mcbride jamie o neal kenny rogers and keith urban reached number 58 in july 2001
the song re entered the chart following the september 11 terrorist attacks
popularity of the song increased greatly following the september 11 2001 attacks at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem
during the first taping of the late show with david letterman following the attacks cbs newsman dan rather cried briefly as he quoted the fourth verse
ray charles is credited with the song s most well known rendition in current times although elvis presley had success with it in the 1970s
charles recording is very commonly played at major sporting and entertainment events such as the super bowl and wrestlemania charles gave a live performance of the song prior to super bowl xxxv the last super bowl played before the september 11 terrorist attacks as well as during game 2 of the 2001 world series after the attacks
he places the third verse first after which he sings the usual first verse
in the third verse see above the author scolds the materialistic and self serving robber barons of her day and urges america to live up to its noble ideals and to honor with both word and deed the memory of those who died for their country
he also performed the song on red sox opening day at fenway park in 2003 though the game was eventually rained out
a version with alicia keys was included in charles 2005 duets album genius friends
music icon beyonce knowles sung the song for president barack obama s inauguration
symbolically marian anderson a noted opera singer of her day sang a rendition of america the beautiful on the steps of the lincoln memorial in 1939 after being refused use of constitution hall by the daughters of the american revolution because of her skin color
years later in 1986 concert singer robbie britt sang the song at the beginning of a professional bowlers tour telecat on espn prior to the first match with that telecast airing just around the 4th of july
in 2009 on her album running for the drum buffy sainte marie released a new version of america the beautiful
her version contained some new lyrics as well as a small modification of the melody
this version includes only two verses the second of which returns to bates original intention see below
wellesley students honor bates with a version at graduation substituting idioms from sea to shining sea is an american idiom meaning from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean or vice versa

assistive technology is an umbrella term that includes assistive adaptive and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities and also includes the process used in selecting locating and using them
at promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish or had great difficulty accomplishing by providing enhancements to or changing methods of interacting with the technology needed to accomplish such tasks
assistive technology and adaptive technology the term adaptive technology is often used as the synonym for assistive technology however they are different terms
assistive technology refers to “ any item piece of equipment or product system whether acquired commercially modified or customized that is used to increase maintain or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities ” while adaptive technology covers items that are specifically designed for persons with disabilities and would seldom be used by non disabled persons
in other words “ assistive technology is any object or system that increases or maintains the capabilities of people with disabilities ” while adaptive technology is “ any object or system that is specifically designed for the purpose of increasing or maintaining the capabilities of people with disabilities ”
consequently adaptive technology is a subset of assistive technology
adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access
mobility impairment and wheelchairs wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and are designed to be a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy
wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility related activities of daily living which include feeding toileting dressing grooming and bathing
the devices comes in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick or other input devices
often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers
wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness injury or disability
people with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker
mobility impairment and walkers a walker or walking frame or rollator is a tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking
it consists of a frame that is about waist high approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user
walkers are also available in other sizes such as pediatric or bariatric
modern walkers are height adjustable
the front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it
it is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front
personal emergency response systems personal emergency response systems pers or telecare uk term are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer
an example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors thermometers for hypothermia risk flooding and unlit gas sensors for people with mild dementia
notably these alerts can be customized to the particular person s risks
when the alert is triggered a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately
accessibility software in human – computer interaction computer accessibility also known as accessible computing refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people regardless of disability or severity of impairment examples include web accessibility guidelines
another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal such as a smart card that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed text size etc to their particular needs
this is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in libraries atm information kiosks etc
the concept is encompassed by the cen en 1332 4 identification card systems man machine interface
this development of this standard has been supported in europe by snapi and has been successfully incorporated into the lasseo specifications but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers
assistive technology for visual impairment many people with serious visual impairments live independently using a wide range of tools and techniques
examples of assistive technology for visually impairment include the canadian currency tactile feature which a system of raised dots in one corner based on braille cells but not standard braille
for general computer use access technology such as screen reader s screen magnifier s and refreshable braille display s has been widely taken up along with standalone reading aids that integrate a scanner optical character recognition ocr software and speech software in a single machine

augmentative and alternative communication augmentative and alternative communication aac is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language
aac systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user
they may be as basic as pictures on a board that the are used to request food drink or other care or they can be advanced speech generating device s based on speech synthesis that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words
assistive technology for cognition assistive technology for cognition atc is the use of technology usually high tech to augment and assistive cognitive processes such as attention memory self regulation navigation emotion recognition and management planning and sequencing activity
systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of atc are growing rapidly but have focused on memory and planning that there is emerging evidence for efficacy that a lot of scope exists to develop new atc
examples of atc include neuropage which prompt users about meetings wakamaru which provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and calls for help if something is wrong and telephone reassurance systems
prosthesis a prosthesis prosthetic or prosthetic limb is a device that replaces a missing body part
it is part of the field of biomechatronics the science of using mechanical devices with human muscle skeleton and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by trauma disease or defect
prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury traumatic or missing from birth congenital or to supplement defective body parts
inside the body artificial heart valve s are in common use with artificial heart s and lungs seeing less common use but under active technology development
other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include hearing aids artificial eyes palatal obturator gastric bands and dentures
prostheses are specifically not orthoses although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis
prostheses are technically the complete finished item
for instance a c leg knee alone is not a prosthesis but only a prosthetic component
the complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system to the residual limb — usually a socket and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device
keep this in mind as nomenclature is often interchanged
it should be noted that the terms prosthetic and orthotic are adjectives used to describe devices such as a prosthetic knee
the terms prosthetics and orthotics are used to describe the respective allied health fields
the devices themselves are properly referred to as prostheses and orthoses in the plural and prosthesis and orthosis in the singular
assistive technology and sports assistive technology and sports is an area of technology design that is growing
assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play
assistive technology may be used in adaptive sports where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate or assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind
an increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports leading to the development of new assistive technology
assistive technology devices can be simple or low tech or they may use highly advanced technology with some even using computers
assistive technology for sports may also be simple or advanced
accordingly assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to elite paralympic games
more complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time and as a result sports for people with disabilities have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition oriented activity
computer accessibility one of the largest problems that affect patients with disabilities is discomfort with prosthesis
a new computer program is used to create the most comfortable and useful prosthetics
an experiment performed in massachusetts utilized 20 patients with various sensors attached to their arms
the patients tried different arm exercises and the sensors recorded their movements
all of the data helped engineers develop new engineering concepts that for prosthetics
alternatively assistive technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves such as dvorak and other alternative layouts which offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys
assistive technology devices have now been created to enable patients with disabilities to use modern touch screen mobile computers such as the ipad iphone and ipod touch
the pererro is a plug and play adapter for ios devices which uses the built in apple voiceover feature in combination with a basic switch
this brings touch screen technology to those who were previously unable to use it

the abacus plural abaci or abacuses also called a counting frame is a calculating tool used primarily in parts of asia for performing arithmetic processes
today abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood stone or metal
the abacus was in use centuries before the adoption of the written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants traders and clerks in asia africa and elsewhere
the user of an abacus is called an abacist
etymology the use of the word abacus dates before 1387 ad when a middle english work borrowed the word from latin to describe a sandboard abacus
the latin word came from greek ἄβαξ abax board strewn with sand or dust used for drawing geometric figures or calculating the exact shape of the latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the greek word ἄβακoς abakos
greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a northwest semitic perhaps phoenician word akin to hebrew ʾābāq אבק dust since dust strewn on wooden boards to draw figures in
the preferred plural of abacus is a subject of disagreement with both abacuses and abaci in use
history mesopotamian the period 2700 – 2300 bc saw the first appearance of the sumer ian abacus a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system
some scholars point to a character from the babylon ian cuneiform which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus
it is the belief of old babylonian scholars such as carruccio that old babylonians may have used the abacus for the operations of addition and subtraction however this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations
egyptian the use of the abacus in ancient egypt is mentioned by the greek historian herodotus who writes that the egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left opposite in direction to the greek left to right method
archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters
however wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered casting some doubt over the extent to which this instrument was used
persian during the achaemenid persian empire around 600 bc the persians first began to use the abacus
under parthian and sassanian iran ian empires scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions by the countries around them – india china and the roman empire when it is thought to be expanded over the other countries
greek the earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the greek abacus dates to the 5th century bc
the greek abacus was a table of wood or marble pre set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations
this greek abacus saw use in achaemenid persia the etruscan civilization ancient rome and until the french revolution the western christian world
a tablet found on the greek island salamis in 1846 ad the salamis tablet dates back to 300 bc making it the oldest counting board discovered so far
it is a slab of white marble long wide and thick on which are 5 groups of markings
in the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom most horizontal line and the single vertical line
below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it
below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection the third sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line
roman the normal method of calculation in ancient rome as in greece was by moving counters on a smooth table
originally pebbles calculi were used
later and in medieval europe jeton s were manufactured
marked lines indicated units fives tens etc as in the roman numeral system
this system of counter casting continued into the late roman empire and in medieval europe and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century
due to pope sylvester ii s reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications it became widely used in europe once again during the 11th century writing in the 1st century bc horace refers to the wax abacus a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus
one example of archaeological evidence of the roman abacus shown here in reconstruction dates to the 1st century ad
it has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each
the groove marked i indicates units x tens and so on up to millions
the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives – five units five tens etc essentially in a bi quinary coded decimal system obviously related to the roman numerals
the short grooves on the right may have been used for marking roman ounces
chinese the earliest known written documentation of the chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century bc
the chinese abacus known as the suànpán 算盤 lit
counting tray is typically tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator
it usually has more than seven rods
there are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom for both decimal and hexadecimal computation
the beads are usually rounded and made of a hardwood
the beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam
if you move them toward the beam you count their value
if you move away you do n t count their value
the suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick jerk along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center
suanpans can be used for functions other than counting
unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do multiplication division addition subtraction square root and cube root operations at high speed
there are currently schools teaching students how to use it
in the famous long scroll along the river during the qingming festival painted by zhang zeduan 1085 – 1145 ad during the song dynasty 960 – 1297 ad a suanpan is clearly seen lying beside an account book and doctor s prescriptions on the counter of an apothecary s feibao
the similarity of the roman abacus to the chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the roman empire and china
however no direct connection can be demonstrated and the similarity of the abaci may be coincidental both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand
where the roman model like most modern japanese has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2 allowing use with a hexadecimal numeral system
instead of running on wires as in the chinese and japanese models the beads of roman model run in grooves presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower
another possible source of the suanpan is chinese counting rods which operated with a decimal system but lacked the concept of zero as a place holder
the zero was probably introduced to the chinese in the tang dynasty 618 907 ad when travel in the indian ocean and the middle east would have provided direct contact with india allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from indian merchants and mathematicians
indian first century sources such as the abhidharmakosa describe the knowledge and use of abacus in india
around the 5th century indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the abacus
hindu texts used the term shunya zero to indicate the empty column on the abacus
japanese in japanese the abacus is called soroban lit
counting tray imported from china around 1600
the 1 4 abacus which is suited to decimal calculation appeared circa 1930 and became widespread as the japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in china
the abacus is still manufactured in japan today even with the proliferation practicality and affordability of pocket electronic calculator s the use of the soroban is still taught in japanese primary school s as part of mathematics primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation
using visual imagery of a soroban one can arrive at the answer in the same time as or even faster than is possible with a physical instrument
korean the chinese abacus migrated from china to korea around 1400 ad
koreans call it jupan 주판 supan 수판 or jusan 주산
native american some sources mention the use of an abacus called a nepohualtzintzin in ancient mayan culture
this mesoamerican abacus used a 5 digit base 20 system
the word nepōhualtzintzin comes from the nahuatl and it is formed by the roots ne personal pōhual or pōhualli the account and tzintzin small similar elements
and its complete meaning was taken as counting with small similar elements by somebody
its use was taught in the calmecac to the temalpouhqueh who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies from childhood
unfortunately the nepōhualtzintzin and its teaching were among the victims of the conquering destruction when a diabolic origin was attributed to them after observing the tremendous properties of representation precision and speed of calculations
this arithmetic tool was based on the vigesimal system base 20
for the aztec the count by 20s was completely natural
the amount of 4 5 13 20 and other cyclees meant cycles
the nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord
in the left part there were four beads which in the first row have unitary values 1 2 3 and 4 and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5 10 and 15 respectively
in order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows it is enough to multiply by 20 by each row the value of the corresponding account in the first row
altogether there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one which made up 91 beads in each nepōhualtzintzin
this was a basic number to understand 7 times 13 a close relation conceived between natural phenomena the underworld and the cycles of the heavens
one nepōhualtzintzin 91 represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts two nepōhualtzitzin 182 is the number of days of the corn s cycle from its sowing to its harvest three nepōhualtzintzin 273 is the number of days of a baby s gestation and four nepōhualtzintzin 364 completed a cycle and approximate a year 1 days short
the nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in floating point which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision meant that no round off was allowed when translated into modern computer arithmetic
the rediscovery of the nepōhualtzintzin was due to the mexican engineer david esparza hidalgo who in his wanderings throughout mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold jade encrustations of shell etc
there have also been found very old nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the olmec a culture and even some bracelets of mayan origin as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures
george i sanchez arithmetic in maya austin texas 1961 found another base 5 base 4 abacus in the yucatán that also computed calendar data
this was a finger abacus on one hand 0 1 2 3 and 4 were used and on the other hand used 0 1 2 and 3 were used
note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles
sanchez worked with sylvanus morley a noted mayanist
the quipu of the inca s was a system of knotted cords used to record numerical data like advanced tally stick s – but not used to perform calculations
calculations were carried out using a yupana quechua for counting tool see figure which was still in use after the conquest of peru
the working principle of a yupana is unknown but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by italian mathematician nicolino de pasquale
by comparing the form of several yupanas researchers found that calculations were based using the fibonacci sequence 1 1 2 3 5 and powers of 10 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument
using the fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at minimum
russian the russian abacus the schoty счёты usually has a single slanted deck with ten beads on each wire except one wire usually positioned near the user with four beads for quarter ruble fractions
older models have another 4 bead wire for quarter kopeks which were minted until 1916
the russian abacus is often used vertically with wires from left to right in the manner of a book
the wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides
it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right
during manipulation beads are moved to the left
for easy viewing the middle 2 beads on each wire the 5th and 6th bead usually are of a different colour from the other eight beads
likewise the left bead of the thousands wire and the million wire if present may have a different color
as a simple cheap and reliable device the russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the former soviet union and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s
even the 1874 invention of mechanical calculator odhner arithmometer had not replaced them in russia and likewise the mass production of felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the soviet union
russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of microcalculator s had started in the soviet union in 1974
today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator
the russian abacus was brought to france around 1820 by the mathematician jean victor poncelet who served in napoleon s army and had been a prisoner of war in russia
the abacus had fallen out of use in western europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and algorism ic methods
to poncelet s french contemporaries it was something new
poncelet used it not for any applied purpose but as a teaching and demonstration aid
school abacus around the world abaci have been used in pre schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the numeral system and arithmetic
in western countries a bead frame similar to the russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common see image
it is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy
the type of abacus shown here is often used to represent numbers without the use of place value
each bead and each wire has the same value and used in this way it can represent numbers up to 100

jpg uses by the blind an adapted abacus invented by tim cranmer called a cranmer abacus is still commonly used by individuals who are blind
a piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently
this keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them
they use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions multiplication division addition subtraction square root and cubic root
although blind students have benefited from talking calculators the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades both in public schools and state schools for the blind
the abacus teaches mathematical skills that can never be replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students
blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille writer and nemeth code a type of braille code for mathematics but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult
the abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper
many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life
binary abacus the binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers
the abacus shows how numbers letters and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer or via ascii
the device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows
the beads represent a switch on the computer in either an on or off position

an acid from the latin acidus ac ēre meaning sour is a substance which reacts with a base
commonly acids can be identified as tasting sour reacting with metals such as calcium and reacting with bases such as sodium carbonate
aqueous acids have a ph under 7 with acidity increasing the lower the ph
chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic
common examples of acids include acetic acid vinegar is a dilute solution of this liquid sulfuric acid used in car batteries hydrochloric acid a solution of this gas is used in the stomach for enzymes and tartaric acid a solid used in baking
as these examples show acids can be solution s or pure substances and can be derived from solid s liquid s or gas es
strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive but there are exceptions such as carborane s and boric acid
there are three common definitions for acids the arrhenius definition the brønsted lowry definition and the lewis definition
the arrhenius definition defines acids as substances which increase the concentration of hydronium ions h3o in solution
the brønsted lowry definition is an expansion an acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor while a base acts as a proton acceptor
by this definition any compound which can easily be deprotonated can be considered an acid
examples include alcohols and amines which contain o h or n h fragments
lewis acids are electron pair acceptors while lewis bases donate an electron pair
examples of lewis acids include all metal cations and electron deficient molecules such as boron trifluoride and aluminium trichloride
definitions and concepts modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids
most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions or can be dissolved in water so the arrhenius and brønsted lowry definitions are the most relevant
the brønsted lowry definition is the most widely used definition unless otherwise specified acid base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton h from an acid to a base
hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions
interestingly although alcohols and amines can be brønsted lowry acids they can also function as lewis base s due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms
arrhenius acids the swedish chemist svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions h or proton s in 1884
an arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of h ions in the water
note that chemists often write h aq and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus a proton does not exist alone in water it exists as the hydronium ion h3o
thus an arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water
this definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation of water into hydronium and hydroxide oh − ions in pure water the majority of molecules are h2o but the molecules are constantly dissociating and re associating and at any time a small number of the molecules always near 1 in 107 are hydronium and an equal number are hydroxide
because the numbers are equal pure water is neutral not acidic or basic
an arrhenius base on the other hand is a substance which decreases the concentration of hydronium ions when dissolved in water
the constant association and disassociation of h2o molecules forms an equilibrium in which any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide thus an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration with an arrhenius base increasing it
the reason that phs of acids are less than 7 is that the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10 − 7 moles per liter
since ph is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions acids thus have phs of less than 7
brønsted lowry acids while the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it is also quite limited in its scope
in 1923 chemists johannes nicolaus brønsted and thomas martin lowry independently recognized that acid base reactions involve the transfer of a proton
a brønsted lowry acid or simply brønsted acid is a species that donates a proton to a brønsted lowry base
brønsted lowry acid base theory has several advantages over arrhenius theory
consider the following reactions of acetic acid ch3cooh the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste both theories easily describe the first reaction ch3cooh acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of h3o when dissolved in water and it acts as a brønsted acid by donating a proton to water
in the second example ch3cooh undergoes the same transformation in this case donating a proton to ammonia nh3 but can not be described using the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium
brønsted lowry theory can also be used to describe molecular compounds whereas arrhenius acids must be ionic compounds
hydrogen chloride hcl and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride nh4cl
in aqueous solution hcl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions
the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrhenius s definition as with the acetic acid reactions both definitions work for the first example where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the hcl solute
the next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions
in the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia dissolved in benzene react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous hcl and nh3 combine to form the solid
lewis acids a third concept was proposed in 1923 by gilbert n lewis which includes reactions with acid base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer
a lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species in other words it is an electron pair acceptor
brønsted acid base reactions are proton transfer reactions while lewis acid base reactions are electron pair transfers
all brønsted acid s are also lewis acid s but not all lewis acids are brønsted acids
contrast the following reactions which could be described in terms of acid base chemistry
in the first reaction a fluoride ion f − gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate
fluoride loses a pair of valence electron s because the electrons shared in the b — f bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion
bf3 is a lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride
this reaction can not be described in terms of brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer
the second reaction can be described using either theory
a proton is transferred from an unspecified brønsted acid to ammonia a brønsted base alternatively ammonia acts as a lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion
the species that gains the electron pair is the lewis acid for example the oxygen atom in h3o gains a pair of electrons when one of the h — o bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen
depending on the context a lewis acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile
dissociation and equilibrium reactions of acids are often generalized in the form ha h a − where ha represents the acid and a − is the conjugate base
acid base conjugate pairs differ by one proton and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton protonation and deprotonation respectively
note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as ha h a in solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base
the equilibrium constant k is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution
brackets indicate concentration such that h2o means the concentration of h2o
the acid dissociation constant ka is generally used in the context of acid base reactions
the numerical value of ka is equal to the concentration of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants where the reactant is the acid ha and the products are the conjugate base and h
the stronger of two acids will have a higher ka than the weaker acid the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton
because the range of possible values for ka spans many orders of magnitude a more manageable constant pka is more frequently used where pka log10 ka
stronger acids have a smaller pka than weaker acids
experimentally determined pka at 25 ° c in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material
nomenclature in the classical naming system acids are named according to their anion s that ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix and sometimes prefix according to the table below
for example hcl has chloride as its anion so the ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid
in the iupac naming system aqueous is simply added to the name of the ionic compound
thus for hydrogen chloride the iupac name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride
the prefix hydro is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element
classical naming system acid strength the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton
a strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water in other words one mole of a strong acid ha dissolves in water yielding one mole of h and one mole of the conjugate base a − and none of the protonated acid ha
in contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution
examples of strong acid s are hydrochloric acid hcl hydroiodic acid hi hydrobromic acid hbr perchloric acid hclo4 nitric acid hno3 and sulfuric acid h2so4
in water each of these essentially ionizes 100
the stronger an acid is the more easily it loses a proton h
two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the h — a bond and the size of atom a which determines the strength of the h — a bond
acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base
stronger acids have a larger ka and a more negative pka than weaker acids
sulfonic acids which are organic oxyacids are a class of strong acids
a common example is toluenesulfonic acid tosylic acid
unlike sulfuric acid itself sulfonic acids can be solids
in fact polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable
superacid s are acids stronger than 100 sulfuric acid
examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid magic acid and perchloric acid
superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic crystalline hydronium salts
they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocation s while ka measures the strength of an acid compound the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution
the ph of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound s ka
chemical characteristics monoprotic acids monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation sometimes called ionization as shown below symbolized by ha common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acid s include hydrochloric acid hcl and nitric acid hno3
on the other hand for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid
examples in organic acids include formic acid hcooh acetic acid ch3cooh and benzoic acid c6h5cooh
polyprotic acids polyprotic acids also known as polybasic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule
specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic acid two potential protons to donate and triprotic acid three potential protons to donate
a diprotic acid here symbolized by h2a can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph
each dissociation has its own dissociation constant ka1 and ka2
the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second i e ka1 ka2
for example sulfuric acid h2so4 can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion hso4 − for which ka1 is very large then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion so42 wherein the ka2 is intermediate strength
the large ka1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid
in a similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid h2co3 can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion hco3 − and lose a second to form carbonate anion co32
both ka values are small but ka1 ka2
a triprotic acid h3a can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where ka1 ka2 ka3
an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid h3po4 usually just called phosphoric acid
all three protons can be successively lost to yield h2po4 − then hpo42 and finally po43 the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate
an organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion
even though the positions of the protons on the original molecule may be equivalent the successive ka values will differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged
although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable all of the conjugate bases are present in solution
the fractional concentration α alpha for each species can be calculated
for example a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution h2a ha and a2
the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph which can be converted to the h or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases alpha alpha alpha a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph for given k1 and k2 is known as a bjerrum plot
a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n protic acid that has been deprotonated i times alpha where k0 1 and the other k terms are the dissociation constants for the acid
neutralization neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base producing a salt and neutralized base for example hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water neutralization is the basis of titration where a ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid
it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with ph 7 0 which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction
neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt
an example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia
conversely neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt e g sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide
weak acid – weak base equilibrium in order for a protonated acid to lose a proton the ph of the system must rise above the pka of the acid
the decreased concentration of h in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form the deprotonated form of the acid
in lower ph more acidic solutions there is a high enough h concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form
solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solution s applications of acids there are numerous uses for acids
acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling
they may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery such as sulfuric acid in a car battery
strong acids sulfuric acid in particular are widely used in mineral processing
for example phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid purifying the solution and electrowinning
in the chemical industry acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts
for example nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate a fertilizer
additionally carboxylic acid s can be esterified with alcohol s to produce ester s acids are used as additives to drinks and foods as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives
phosphoric acid for example is a component of cola drinks
acetic acid is used in day to day life as vinegar
carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda
citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles
tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind
natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids
citric acid is present in oranges lemon and other citrus fruits
oxalic acid is present in tomatoes spinach and especially in carambola and rhubarb rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid
ascorbic acid vitamin c is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla lemon citrus fruits and guava
certain acids are used as drugs
acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers
acids play important roles in the human body
the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules
amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues
fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues
nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of dna and rna and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes
carbonic acid is important for maintenance of ph equilibrium in the body
acid catalysis acids are used as catalyst s in industrial and organic chemistry for example sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline
strong acids such as sulfuric phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration and condensation reaction s in biochemistry many enzyme s employ acid catalysis
biological occurrence many biologically important molecules are acids
nucleic acid s which contain acidic phosphate groups include dna and rna
nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism s characteristics and is passed from parents to offspring
dna contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of protein s which are made up of amino acid subunits
cell membrane s contain fatty acid ester s such as phospholipids
an α amino acid has a central carbon the α or alpha carbon which is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group thus they are carboxylic acid s an amino group a hydrogen atom and a variable group
the variable group also called the r group or side chain determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid
in glycine the simplest amino acid the r group is a hydrogen atom but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens and may contain other elements such as sulfur oxygen or nitrogen
with the exception of glycine naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the l configuration
peptidoglycan found in some bacteria l cell wall s contains some d amino acids
at physiological ph typically around 7 free amino acids exist in a charged form where the acidic carboxyl group cooh loses a proton coo − and the basic amine group nh2 gains a proton nh3
the entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains
aspartic acid for example possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups for a net charge of − 1 at physiological ph
fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology
these contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end
the cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar hydrophilic phosphate head groups
membranes contain additional components some of which can participate in acid base reactions
in humans and many other animals hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze protein s and polysaccharide s as well as converting the inactive pro enzyme pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin
some organisms produce acids for defense for example ants produce formic acid
acid base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammal ian breathing
oxygen gas o2 drives cellular respiration the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food producing carbon dioxide co2 as a byproduct
oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation
for example during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrate s and fat releasing co2 into the blood stream
in aqueous solutions such as blood co2 exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion
it is the decrease in ph that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper expelling the excess co2 and resupplying the cells with o2
cell membrane s are generally impermeable to charged or large polar molecules because of the lipophilic fatty acyl chains comprising their interior
many biologically important molecules including a number of pharmaceutical agents are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated uncharged form but not in their charged form i e as the conjugate base
for this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods
the charged form however is often more soluble in blood and cytosol both aqueous environments
when the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral ph within the cell certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer
acids that lose a proton at the intracellular ph will exist in their soluble charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target
ibuprofen aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids
common acids mineral acids inorganic acids sulfonic acids carboxylic acids vinylogous carboxylic acids normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxy group
in vinylogous carboxylic acids a carbon carbon double bond separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups

asphalt or or also known as bitumen is a sticky black and highly viscous liquid or semi solid form of petroleum
it may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product it is a substance classed as a pitch
until the 20th century the term asphaltum was also used
the primary use of asphalt bitumen is in road construction where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete
its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs
the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance
in american english asphalt or asphalt cement is the carefully refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils
outside the united states the product is often called bitumen
geological terminology often prefers the term bitumen
common usage often refers to various forms of asphalt bitumen as tar such as at the la brea tar pits
another term mostly archaic refers to asphalt bitumen as pitch
the pitch used in this mixture is sometimes found in natural deposits but usually made by the distillation of crude oil
naturally occurring asphalt bitumen is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen
its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen
etymology the word asphalt is derived from the late middle english in turn from french asphalte based on late latin asphalton asphaltum which is the latinisation of the greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos ásphalton a word meaning asphalt bitumen pitch which perhaps derives from α without and σφάλλω sfallō make fall
note that in french the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring bitumen soaked limestone deposits and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads
it is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application
specifically herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall
from the greek the word passed into late latin and thence into french asphalte and english asphaltum and asphalt
the expression bitumen originated in the sanskrit where we find the words jatu meaning pitch and jatu krit meaning pitch creating pitch producing referring to coniferous or resinous trees
the latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu men pertaining to pitch and by others pixtumens exuding or bubbling pitch which was subsequently shortened to bitumen thence passing via french into english
from the same root is derived the anglo saxon word cwidu mastix the german word kitt cement or mastic and the old norse word kvada
neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars
modern usage in british english the word asphalt is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and asphalt bitumen also called tarmac in common parlance
the earlier word asphaltum is now archaic and not commonly used
in american english asphalt is equivalent to the british bitumen
however asphalt is also commonly used as a shortened form of asphalt concrete therefore equivalent to the british asphalt or tarmac
in australian english bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces
in canadian english the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product used to pave roads and manufacture roof shingle s and various waterproofing products
diluted bitumen diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines is known as dilbit in the canadian petroleum industry while bitumen upgraded to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen as synbit
bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi solid form of petroleum
bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen
the oil sands of alberta canada are a similar material
chemistry the substance is completely soluble in carbon disulfide and composed primarily of a mixture of highly condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon s it is most commonly modelled as a colloid with asphaltene s as the dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase though there is some disagreement amongst chemist s regarding its structure
one writer stated although a considerable amount of work has been done on the composition of asphalt it is exceedingly difficult to separate individual hydrocarbon in pure form and it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large
most natural bitumens contain sulfur and several heavy metals such as nickel vanadium lead chromium mercury arsenic selenium and other toxic elements
bitumens can provide good preservation of plants and animal fossils
asphalt bitumen can sometimes be confused with tar which is a similar black thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal
during the early and mid 20th century when town gas was produced tar was a readily available product and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates
the addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac which is now used in common parlance to refer to road making materials
however since the 1970s when natural gas succeeded town gas asphalt bitumen has completely overtaken the use of tar in these applications
other examples of this confusion include the la brea tar pits and the canadian tar sands
pitch is another term mistakenly used at times to refer to asphalt bitumen as in pitch lake
natural deposits of asphalt bitumen include lakes such as the pitch lake in trinidad and tobago and lake bermudez in venezuela gilsonite the dead sea asphalt bitumen impregnated sandstones known as bituminous rock and the similar tar sands
asphalt bitumen was mined at ritchie mines in macfarlan in ritchie county west virginia in the united states from 1852 to 1873
bituminous rock was mined at many locations in the united states for use as a paving material primarily during the late 1800s
asphalt bitumen can be separated from the other components in crude oil such as naphtha gasoline and diesel by the process of fractional distillation usually under vacuum conditions
a better separation can be achieved by further processing of the heavier fractions of the crude oil in a de asphalting unit which uses either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to dissolve the lighter molecules which are then separated
further processing is possible by blowing the product namely reacting it with oxygen
this makes the product harder and more viscous
asphalt bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 ° c 300 ° f
sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity upon delivery these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture
this mixture is often called bitumen feedstock or bfs
some dump truck s route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm
the backs of tippers carrying asphalt bitumen as well as some handling equipment are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release
diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns
history geological origin naturally occurring deposits of asphalt bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient microscopic algae diatom s and other once living things
these remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived
under the heat above 50 ° c and pressure of burial deep in the earth the remains were transformed into materials such as asphalt bitumen kerogen or petroleum
deposits at the la brea tar pits are an example
there are structural similarities between asphalt bitumen and the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites
however detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct
ancient times the use of asphalt bitumen for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth millennium b c in the early indus community of mehrgarh where it was used to line the baskets in which they gathered crop s in the ancient middle east the sumer ians used natural asphalt bitumen deposits for mortar between bricks and stones to cement parts of carvings such as eyes into place for ship caulking and for waterproofing
the greek historian herodotus said hot asphalt bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of babylon
in some versions of the book of genesis in the bible the name of the substance used to bind the bricks of the tower of babel is translated as bitumen see gen 11 3 while other translations use the word pitch
a one kilometre tunnel beneath the river euphrates at babylon in the time of queen semiramis ca 800 b c was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with asphalt bitumen as a waterproofing agent
asphalt bitumen was used by ancient egypt ians to embalm mummies
the persian word for asphalt is moom which is related to the english word mummy
the egyptians primary source of asphalt bitumen was the dead sea which the romans knew as palus asphaltites asphalt lake
approximately 40 ad dioscorides described the dead sea material as judaicum bitumen and noted other places in the region where it could be found the judaicum bitumen is better than others that is reckoned the best which doth shine like purple being of a strong scent weightie but the black and fowle is naught for it is adulterated with pitch mixed with it
it growes in phoenice also and in sidon in babylon in zacynthum
it is found also moyst swimming upon wells in the country of the agrigentines of sicilie which they use for lamps instead of oyle and which they call falsely sicilian oyle for it is a kinde of moyst bitumen
the sidon bitumen is thought to refer to asphalt bitumen found at hasbeya
pliny refers also to asphalt bitumen being found in epirus
it was a valuable strategic resource the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit between the seleucid s and the nabateans in 312 b c
in the ancient far east natural asphalt bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions leaving a material of higher molecular weight which is thermoplastic and when layered on objects became quite hard upon cooling
this was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing such as scabbard s and other items
statuettes of household deities were also cast with this type of material in japan and probably also in china
in north america archaeological recovery has indicated asphalt bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone projectile point s to wooden shafts
early use in europe the greek fire which composition was a military secret of the byzantine navy contained among other things asphalt bitumen as a component
100 years after the fall of constantinople in 1453 pierre belon described in his work observations in 1553 that pissasphalto a mixture of pitch and bitumen was used in dubrovnik for tarring of ships from where it was exported to a market place in venice where it could be bought by anyone
an 1838 edition of mechanics magazine cites an early use of asphalt in france
a pamphlet dated 1621 by a certain monsieur d eyrinys states that he had discovered the existence of asphaltum in large quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways principally in the construction of air proof granaries and in protecting by means of the arches the water courses in the city of paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth which at that time made the water unusable
he expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces in palaces the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a parisian of that generation
but it was generally neglected in france until the revolution of 1830
then in the 1830s there was a surge of interest and asphalt became widely used for pavements flat roofs and the lining of cisterns and in england some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes
its rise in europe was a sudden phenomenon after natural deposits were found in france at osbann basrhin the parc l ain and the puy de la poix puy de dome although it could also be made artificially
one of the earliest uses in france was the laying of about 24 000 square yards of seyssel asphalt at the place de la concorde in 1835
photography and art asphalt bitumen was used in early photographic technology
in 1826 or 1827 it was used by french scientist joseph nicéphore niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature
the asphalt bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera
exposure to light hardened the asphalt bitumen and made it insoluble so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light struck areas remained
many hours of exposure in the camera were required making asphalt bitumen impractical for ordinary photography but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes
asphalt bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century
although widely used for a time it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting especially when mixed with the most common dilutents such as linseed oil varnish and turpentine
unless thoroughly diluted asphalt bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact
the use of asphalt bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colours to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of a good many paintings those of delacroix being just one notable example
perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of asphalt bitumen is théodore géricault s raft of the medusa 1818 1819 where his use of asphalt bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle
early use in the united kingdom among the earlier uses of asphalt bitumen in the united kingdom was for etching
william salmon s polygraphice 1673 provides a recipe for varnish used in etching consisting of three ounces of virgin wax two ounces of mastic and one ounce of asphaltum
by the fifth edition in 1685 he had included more asphaltum recipes from other sources
the first british patent for the use of asphalt bitumen was cassell s patent asphalte or bitumen in 1834
then on 25 november 1837 richard tappin claridge patented the use of seyssel asphalt patent 7849 for use in asphalte pavement having seen it employed in france and belgium when visiting with frederick walter simms who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to britain
dr t lamb phipson claims that his father samuel ryland phipson a friend of claridge was also instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement in 1836
indeed mastic pavements had been previously employed at vauxhall by a competitor of claridge but without success
in 1838 claridge obtained patents in scotland on 27 march and ireland on 23 april and in 1851 extensions were sought for all three patents by the trustees of a company previously formed by claridge
this was claridge s patent asphalte company formed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to britain asphalte in its natural state from the mine at pyrimont seysell in france and laid one of the first asphalt pavements in whitehall
trials were made of the pavement in 1838 on the footway in whitehall the stable at knightsbridge barracks and subsequently on the space at the bottom of the steps leading from waterloo place to st james park
the formation in 1838 of claridge s patent asphalte company with a distinguished list of aristocratic patrons and marc and isambard brunel as respectively a trustee and consulting engineer gave an enormous impetus to the development of a british asphalt industry
by the end of 1838 at least two other companies robinson s and the bastenne company were in production with asphalt being laid as paving at brighton herne bay canterbury kensington the strand and a large floor area in bunhill row while meantime claridge s whitehall paving continue d in good order
indeed in 1838 there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity over asphalt bitumen which had uses beyond paving
for example asphalt could also used for flooring damp proofing in buildings and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths with these latter themselves proliferating in the 19th century
on the london stockmarket there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from france germany and england
and numerous patents were granted in france with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in england due to their similarity to each other
in england claridge s was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s in 1914 claridge s company entered into a joint venture to produce tar bound macadam with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called clarmac roads ltd
two products resulted namely clarmac and clarphalte with the former being manufactured by clarmac roads and the latter by claridge s patent asphalte co although clarmac was more widely used
however the first world war impacted financially on the clarmac company which entered into liquidation in 1915
the failure of clarmac roads ltd had a flow on effect to claridge s company which was itself compulsorily wound up ceasing operations in 1917 having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture both at the outset and in a subsequent attempt to save the clarmac company
early use in the united states the first use of asphalt bitumen in the new world was by indigenous peoples
on the west coast as early as the 13th century the tongva luiseño and chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring asphalt bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits
all three used the substance as an adhesive
it is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items
for example it was used on rattle s to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles
it was also used in decorations
small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations
it was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water
asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean going canoes
roads in the us have been paved with materials that include asphalt bitumen since at least 1870 when a street in front of the newark nj city hall was paved
in many cases these early pavings were made from naturally occurring bituminous rock
in 1876 asphalt based paving was used to pave pennsylvania avenue in washington dc in time for the celebration of the national centennial
asphalt bitumen was also used for flooring paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century following similar trends in europe
modern use rolled asphalt concrete the largest use of asphalt bitumen is for making asphalt concrete for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85 of the asphalt consumed in the united states
asphalt concrete pavement material is commonly composed of 5 asphalt bitumen cement and 95 aggregates stone sand and gravel
due to its highly viscous nature asphalt bitumen cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing plant
there are about 4 000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the u s and a similar number in europe
asphalt concrete road surface is the most widely recycled material in the u s both by gross tonnage and by percentage
according to an industry survey conducted by the federal highway administration and the national asphalt pavement association and released in 2011 more than 99 of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements roadbeds shoulders and embankments
roofing shingle s account for most of the remaining asphalt bitumen consumption
other uses include cattle sprays fence post treatments and waterproofing for fabrics
asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world
due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly it is widely used for runways dedicated to aircraft landing and taking off
mastic asphalt mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt asphalt concrete in that it has a higher asphalt bitumen binder content usually around 7 – 10 of the whole aggregate mix as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete which has only around 5 added asphalt bitumen
this thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground
mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 millimeters 0 8 in thick
asphalt emulsion a number of technologies allow asphalt bitumen to be mixed at much lower temperatures
these involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form cutbacks with reduced melting point or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt bitumen into an emulsion
asphalt emulsions contain up to 70 asphalt bitumen and typically less than 1 5 chemical additives
there are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates cationic and anionic
asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications
chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock gravel or crushed slag
slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road
cold mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot mixed asphalt several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot mix asphalt to create low cost pavements
other uses asphalt bitumen is used to make japan black a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel
asphalt bitumen also is used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies primarily molotow to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint and or ink and to make the color much darker
asphalt bitumen is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process
petroleum production alternatives and bioasphalt naturally occurring crude asphalt bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from oil sands currently under development in alberta canada
canada has most of the world s supply of natural asphalt bitumen covering 140 000 square kilometres an area larger than england giving it the second largest proven oil reserves in the world
the athabasca oil sands is the largest asphalt bitumen deposit in canada and the only one accessible to surface mining although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods
because of oil price increases since 2003 upgrading bitumen to synthetic crude oil has become highly profitable
as of 2006 canadian crude asphalt bitumen production averaged about per day and was projected to rise to per day by 2020
the total amount of crude asphalt bitumen in alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about which at a rate of would last about 200 years
certain activist groups have become increasingly concerned about the global peak oil and climate change problem in recent years due to byproducts released into the atmosphere
most of the emissions are derived primarily from burning fossil fuel s this has led to the introduction of petroleum alternatives such as bioasphalt that are more environmentally friendly and less toxic
asphalt bitumen can now be made from nonpetroleum based renewable resources such as sugar molasses and rice corn and potato starch es
asphalt bitumen can also be made from waste material by fractional distillation of used motor oil s which is sometimes disposed by burning or dumping into landfills
nonpetroleum based asphalt bitumen binders can be made light colored
lighter colored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation and have less surface heat than darker surfaces reducing their contribution to the urban heat island effect

the american national standards institute ansi is a private non profit organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products services processes systems and personnel in the united states
the organization also coordinates u s standards with international standards so that american products can be used worldwide
for example standards ensure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for that camera anywhere around the globe
ansi accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other standards organization s government agencies consumer groups companies and others
these standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent that people use the same definitions and terms and that products are tested the same way
ansi also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards
the organization s headquarters are in washington dc
ansi s operations office is located in new york city
the ansi annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications membership dues and fees accreditation services fee based programs and international standards programs
history ansi was originally formed in 1918 when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the american engineering standards committee aesc
in 1928 the aesc became the american standards association asa
in 1966 the asa was reorganized and became the united states of america standards institute usasi
the present name was adopted in 1969
prior to 1918 these five founding engineering societies had been members of the united engineering society ues
at the behest of the aiee they invited the u s government departments of war navy combined in 1947 to become the department of defense or dod and commerce to join in founding a national standards organization
according to paul g agnew the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919 aesc started as an ambitious program and little else
staff for the first year consisted of one executive clifford b lepage who was on loan from a founding member asme
an annual budget of 7 500 was provided by the founding bodies
in 1931 the organization renamed asa in 1928 became affiliated with the u s national committee of the international electrotechnical commission iec which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards
members ansi s membership comprises government agencies organizations corporations academic and international bodies and individuals
in total the institute represents the interests of more than 125 000 companies and 3 5 million professionals
process though ansi itself does not develop standards the institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations
ansi accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the institute s requirements for openness balance consensus and due process
ansi also designates specific standards as american national standards or ans when the institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders
voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers
there are approximately 9 500 american national standards that carry the ansi designation
the american national standards process involves international activities in addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the u s ansi promotes the use of u s standards internationally advocates u s policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate
the institute is the official u s representative to the two major international standards organizations the international organization for standardization iso as a founding member and the international electrotechnical commission iec via the u s national committee usnc
ansi participates in almost the entire technical program of both the iso and the iec and administers many key committees and subgroups
in many instances u s standards are taken forward to iso and iec through ansi or the usnc where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards
standards panels the institute administers five standards panels each of the panels works to identify coordinate and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas
in 2009 ansi and the national institute for standards and technology nist formed the nuclear energy standards coordination collaborative nescc
nescc is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry

apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first humans americans neil armstrong and buzz aldrin on the moon on july 20 1969 at 20 18 utc
armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface 6 hours later on july 21 at 02 56 utc
armstrong spent about two and a half hours outside the spacecraft aldrin slightly less and together they collected of lunar material for return to earth
a third member of the mission michael collins piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until armstrong and aldrin returned to it just under a day later for the trip back to earth
launched by a saturn v rocket from kennedy space center in merritt island florida on july 16 apollo 11 was the fifth manned mission of nasa s apollo program
the apollo spacecraft had three parts a command module with a cabin for the three astronauts which was the only part which landed back on earth a service module which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and a lunar module for landing on the moon
after being sent to the moon by the saturn v s upper stage the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and travelled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit
armstrong and aldrin then moved into the lunar module and landed in the sea of tranquility
they stayed a total of about 21 and a half hours on the lunar surface
after lifting off in the upper part of the lunar module and rejoining collins in the command module they returned to earth and landed in the pacific ocean on july 24
broadcast on live tv to a world wide audience armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind
apollo 11 effectively ended the space race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by the late u s president john f kennedy in a speech before the united states congress before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
framework crew each crewman of apollo 11 had made a spaceflight before this mission making it only the second all veteran crew the other being apollo 10 in human spaceflight history
collins was originally slated to be the command module pilot cmp on apollo 8 but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by jim lovell his backup for that flight
after collins was medically cleared he took what would have been lovell s spot on apollo 11 as a veteran of apollo 8 lovell was transferred to apollo 11 s backup crew but promoted to backup commander
backup crew in early 1969 bill anders accepted a job with the national space council effective in august 1969 and announced his retirement as an astronaut
at that point ken mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with anders as backup command module pilot in case apollo 11 was delayed past its intended july launch at which point anders would be unavailable if needed and would later join lovell s crew and ultimately be assigned as the original apollo 13 cmp
support crew flight directors call signs after the crew of apollo 10 named their spacecraft charlie brown and snoopy assistant manager for public affairs julian scheer wrote to manned spacecraft center director george m low to suggest the apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft
during early mission planning the names snowcone and haystack were used and put in the news release but the crew later decided to change them
the command module was named columbia after the columbiad the giant cannon shell spacecraft fired by a giant cannon coincidentally from florida in jules verne s 1865 novel from the earth to the moon
the lunar module was named eagle for the national bird of the united states the bald eagle which is featured prominently on the mission insignia
insignia the apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by collins who wanted a symbol for peaceful lunar landing by the united states
he chose an eagle as the symbol put an olive branch in its beak and drew a lunar background with the earth in the distance
nasa officials said the talons of the eagle looked too warlike and after some discussion the olive branch was moved to the claws
the crew decided the roman numeral xi would not be understood in some nations and went with apollo 11 they decided not to put their names on the patch so it would be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing
all colors are natural with blue and gold borders around the patch
when the eisenhower dollar coin was released a few years later the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side
the design was retained for the smaller susan b anthony dollar which was unveiled in 1979 ten years after the apollo 11 mission
mementos neil armstrong s ppk personal preference kit carried a piece of wood from the wright brothers 1903 airplane s left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing along with a diamond studded astronaut pin originally given to deke slayton by the widows of the apollo 1 crew
this pin had been intended to be flown on apollo 1 and given to slayton after the mission but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals the widows gave the pin to slayton and armstrong took it on apollo 11
mission highlights launch and flight to lunar orbit in addition to throngs of people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site millions watched the event on television with nasa chief of public information jack king providing commentary
president richard nixon viewed the proceedings from the oval office of the white house
a saturn v launched apollo 11 from launch pad 39a part of the launch complex 39 site at the kennedy space center on july 16 1969 at 13 32 00 utc 9 32 00 a m edt local time
it entered orbit 12 minutes later
after one and a half orbits the s ivb third stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the moon with the trans lunar injection burn at 16 22 13 utc
about 30 minutes later the command service module pair separated from this last remaining saturn v stage and docked with the lunar module still nestled in the lunar module adaptor
after the lunar module was extracted the combined spacecraft headed for the moon while the third stage booster flew on a trajectory past the moon and into heliocentric orbit
on july 19 at 17 21 50 utc apollo 11 passed behind the moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit
in the thirty orbits that followed the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern sea of tranquility mare tranquillitatis about southwest of the crater sabine d 0 67408 n 23 47297 e
the landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated ranger 8 and surveyor 5 landers along with the lunar orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extra vehicular activity eva challenges
lunar descent on july 20 1969 the lunar module lm eagle separated from the command module columbia
collins alone aboard columbia inspected eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged
as the descent began armstrong and aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface 4 seconds early and reported that they were long they would land miles west of their target point
five minutes into the descent burn and above the surface of the moon the lm navigation and guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1202 and 1201 program alarms
inside mission control center in houston texas computer engineer jack garman told guidance officer steve bales it was safe to continue the descent and this was relayed to the crew
the program alarms indicated executive overflows meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them
in a letter to datamation march 1 1971 margaret h hamilton director of apollo flight computer programming mit draper laboratory cambridge massachusetts stated “ due to an error in the checklist manual the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position
this caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer
the result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15 of its time
the computer or rather the software in it was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing
it then sent out an alarm which meant to the astronaut i m overloaded with more tasks than i should be doing at this time and i m going to keep only the more important tasks i e the ones needed for landing actually the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions
a complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software
the software s action in this case was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re establish the more important ones if the computer had n t recognized this problem and taken recovery action i doubt if apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was ”
landing when armstrong again looked outside he saw that the computer s landing target was in a boulder strewn area just north and east of a diameter crater later determined to be west crater named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse
armstrong took semi automatic control and with aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data landed at 20 17 utc on july 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left
apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions and the astronauts also encountered a premature low fuel warning
this was later found to have been due to greater propellant slosh than expected uncovering a fuel sensor
on subsequent missions extra baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this
throughout the descent aldrin had called out navigation data to armstrong who was busy piloting the lm
a few moments before the landing a light informed aldrin that at least one of the probes hanging from eagles footpads had touched the surface and he said contact light
three seconds later eagle landed and armstrong said shutdown
aldrin immediately said okay engine stop
aca out of detent
armstrong acknowledged out of detent
auto and aldrin continued mode control both auto
descent engine command override off
engine arm off
413 is in
charles duke acting as capcom during the landing phase acknowledged their landing by saying we copy you down eagle
armstrong acknowledged aldrin s completion of the post landing checklist with engine arm is off
before responding to duke with the words houston tranquility base here
the eagle has landed
armstrong s change of call sign from eagle to tranquility base confirmed that landing was complete and successful and duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at mission control roger twan tranquility we copy you on the ground
you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue
we re breathing again
thanks a lot
two and a half hours after landing before preparations began for the eva aldrin broadcast that he then took communion privately
at this time nasa was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist madalyn murray o hair who had objected to the apollo 8 crew reading from the book of genesis demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space
as such aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the moon
aldrin was an elder at the webster presbyterian church and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church the rev dean woodruff
aldrin described communion on the moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the october 1970 edition of guideposts magazine and in his book return to earth
webster presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the moon and commemorates the event each year on the sunday closest to july 20
the schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five hour sleep period since they had been awake since early morning
however they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the eva early thinking that they would be unable to sleep
lunar surface operations the astronauts planned placement of the early apollo scientific experiment package easep and the u s flag by studying their landing site through eagles twin triangular windows which gave them a 60 ° field of view
preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled
armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system plss
according to veteran moon walker john young a redesign of the lm to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the plss backpack so some of the highest heart rates recorded from apollo astronauts occurred during lm egress and ingress
armstrong claims to have said that s one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind when he first set foot on the lunar surface
the a is not clear in nasa recordings but the audio and video links back to earth were somewhat intermittent partly because of storms near parkes observatory
more recent digital analysis of the tape by nasa revealed the a may have been spoken but obscured by static
at 02 39 utc on monday july 21 1969 armstrong opened the hatch and at 02 51 utc began his descent to the lunar surface
the remote control unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet
climbing down the nine rung ladder armstrong pulled a d ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly mesa folded against eagle s side and activate the tv camera and at 02 56 15 utc he set his left foot on the surface
the first landing used slow scan television incompatible with commercial tv so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional tv camera viewed this monitor significantly reducing the quality of the picture
the signal was received at goldstone in the united states but with better fidelity by honeysuckle creek tracking station in australia
minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive parkes radio telescope in australia
despite some technical and weather difficulties ghostly black and white images of the first lunar eva were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on earth
although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re use at nasa
after describing the surface dust as very fine grained and almost like a powder armstrong stepped off eagles footpad and uttered his famous line that s one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind six and a half hours after landing
aldrin joined him describing the view as magnificent desolation
about seven minutes after stepping onto the moon s surface armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick
he then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh
this was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the eva and return to the lm
in addition to fulfilling president john f kennedy s mandate to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s apollo 11 was an engineering test of the apollo system therefore armstrong snapped photos of the lm so engineers would be able to judge its post landing condition
he removed the tv camera from the mesa and made a panoramic sweep then mounted it on a tripod from the lm
the tv camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the eva
armstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity one sixth of earth s was even perhaps easier than the simulations it s absolutely no trouble to walk around
aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around including two footed kangaroo hops
the plss backpack created a tendency to tip backwards but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance
loping became the preferred method of movement
the astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead
the fine soil was quite slippery
aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into eagles shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit though the helmet was warmer in sunlight so he felt cooler in shadow
the astronauts planted a specially designed u s flag on the lunar surface in clear view of the tv camera
some time later president richard nixon spoke to them through a telephone radio transmission which nixon called the most historic phone call ever made from the white house
nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call but frank borman who was at the white house as a nasa liaison during apollo 11 convinced nixon to keep his words brief to respect the lunar landing as kennedy s legacy
william safire prepared a speech called in event of moon disaster for president nixon to read on television if the apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the moon
according to the plans mission control would close down communications with the lem and a clergyman would have commended their souls to the deepest of the deep in a public ritual likened to burial at sea
presidential telephone calls to the astronauts wives were also planned
the speech originated in a memo from safire to nixon s chief of staff h r haldeman in which safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster
the last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to rupert brooke s first world war poem the soldier
the mesa failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow slowing work somewhat
as they worked the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits the integrated thermal meteoroid garment
they deployed the easep which included a passive seismograph and a laser ranging retroreflector
then armstrong loped about from the lm to snap photos at the rim of little west crater while aldrin collected two core tubes
he used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes the only time the hammer was used on apollo 11
the astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles
many of the surface activities took longer than expected so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 min
three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts armalcolite tranquillityite and pyroxferroite
armalcolite was named after armstrong aldrin and collins
during this period mission control used a coded phrase to warn armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down
he was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out
however as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk mission control granted the astronauts a 15 minute extension
in a 2010 interview armstrong who had walked a maximum of from the lm explained that nasa limited the first moonwalk s time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts plss backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the moon
lunar ascent and return aldrin entered eagle first
with some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing more than of lunar surface material to the lm hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the lunar equipment conveyor
armstrong reminded aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve and aldrin tossed the bag down armstrong then jumped to the ladder s third rung and climbed into the lm
after transferring to lm life support the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their plss backpacks lunar overshoes one hasselblad camera and other equipment
they then pressurized the lm and settled down to sleep
while moving within the cabin aldrin accidentally broke the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the moon
there was concern this would prevent firing the engine stranding them on the moon
fortunately a felt tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch
had this not worked the lunar module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine
after about seven hours of rest the crew was awakened by houston to prepare for the return flight
two and a half hours later at 17 54 utc they lifted off in eagles ascent stage carrying 21 5 kilograms of lunar samples with them to rejoin cmp michael collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit
during the launch aldrin looked up in time to see the exhaust from the ascent module s engine knock over the american flag they had planted
after more than 2 ½ hours on the lunar surface they had left behind scientific instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment and a passive seismic experiment used to measure moon quakes
they also left an american flag an apollo 1 mission patch and a plaque mounted on the lm descent stage ladder bearing two drawings of earth of the western and eastern hemispheres an inscription and signatures of the astronauts and president richard m nixon
the inscription read they also left behind a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk
the disk carries the goodwill statements by presidents eisenhower kennedy johnson and nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world
the disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the us congress a listing of members of the four committees of the house and senate responsible for the nasa legislation and the names of nasa s past and present top management
in his 1989 book men from earth aldrin says that the items included soviet medals commemorating cosmonaut s vladimir komarov and yuri gagarin
also according to deke slayton s book moonshot armstrong carried with him a special diamond studded astronaut pin from slayton
film taken from the lm ascent stage upon liftoff from the moon reveals the american flag planted some from the descent stage whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine
buzz aldrin witnessed it topple the ascent stage of the lm separated i was concentrating on the computers and neil was studying the attitude indicator but i looked up long enough to see the flag fall over
subsequent apollo missions usually planted the american flags at least from the lm to prevent its being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust
after rendezvous with columbia eagle s ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on july 21 1969 at 23 41 utc
just before the apollo 12 flight it was noted that eagle was still likely to be orbiting the moon
later nasa reports mentioned that eagle s orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an uncertain location on the lunar surface
the location is uncertain because the eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time
nasa estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the moon
on july 23 the last night before splashdown the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which collins commented aldrin added armstrong concluded on the return to earth a bearing at the guam tracking station failed which would have prevented communication on the last segment of the earth return
a regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director charles force had his ten year old son greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease
greg later was thanked by armstrong
splashdown and quarantine on july 24 the astronauts returned home aboard the command module columbia just before dawn local time 16 51 utc at in the pacific ocean east of wake island south of johnston atoll and from the recovery ship uss hornet
at 16 44 utc the drogue parachute s had been deployed and 7 minutes later the command module struck the water forcefully
the command module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts
everything s okay
our checklist is complete
awaiting swimmers was armstrong s last official transmission from the columbia
a diver from the navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the command module to prevent it from drifting
additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction
though the chance of bringing back pathogen s from the lunar surface was considered remote it was considered a possibility and nasa took great precautions at the recovery site
divers provided the astronauts with biological isolation garments bigs which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the hornet
additionally astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and the command module wiped with betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present
the raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk
a second sea king helicopter hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one where a nasa flight surgeon gave each a brief physical check during the trip back to the hornet
after touchdown on the hornet the astronauts exited the helicopter leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen
the helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay 2 where the astronauts walked the to the mobile quarantine facility mqf where they would begin their 21 days of quarantine
this practice would continue for two more apollo missions apollo 12 and apollo 14 before the moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped
president richard nixon was aboard hornet to personally welcome the astronauts back to earth
he told the astronauts as a result of what you ve done the world has never been closer together before
after nixon departed the hornet was brought alongside the five ton command module where it was placed aboard by the ship s crane placed on a dolly and moved next to the mqf
the hornet sailed for pearl harbor where the command module and mqf were airlifted to the johnson space center
years later it was publicly revealed that nixon had prepared a speech to be given in the event the lunar module had failed to lift off from the lunar surface which would have resulted in armstrong s and aldrin s deaths similar to common newspaper obituary or government contingency plan procedures and policies
in accordance with the recently passed extra terrestrial exposure law the astronauts were placed in quarantine for fear that the moon might contain undiscovered pathogen s and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their moon walks
however after almost three weeks in confinement first in their trailer and later in the lunar receiving laboratory at the manned spacecraft center the astronauts were given a clean bill of health
on august 10 1969 the astronauts exited quarantine
celebration on august 13 they rode in parades in their honor in new york chicago and los angeles
on the same evening in los angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight attended by members of congress 44 governors the chief justice of the united states and ambassadors from 83 nations at the century plaza hotel
president richard nixon and vice president spiro t agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the presidential medal of freedom
this celebration was the beginning of a 45 day giant leap tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as queen elizabeth ii of the united kingdom
many nations would honor the first manned moon landing by issuing apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins
on september 16 1969 the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of congress on capitol hill
they presented two u s flags one to the house of representatives and the other to the senate that had been carried to the surface of the moon with them
moon race the soviet union was secretly attempting to compete with the us in landing a man on the moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the saturn v
meanwhile they tried to beat the us to return lunar material to the earth by means of unmanned probes
on july 13 three days before apollo 11 s launch they launched luna 15 which reached lunar orbit before apollo 11
during descent a malfunction caused luna 15 to crash in mare crisium about two hours before armstrong and aldrin took off from the surface
the jodrell bank observatory radio telescope in england was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from luna 15 during its descent and this was published in july 2009 on the 40th anniversary of apollo 11
spacecraft location the command module is displayed at the national air and space museum washington d c
it is in the central milestones of flight exhibition hall in front of the jefferson drive entrance sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the wright flyer the spirit of st louis the bell x 1 the north american x 15 mercury spacecraft friendship 7 and gemini 4
armstrong s and aldrin s space suits are displayed in the museum s apollo to the moon exhibit
the quarantine trailer the flotation collar and the righting spheres are displayed at the smithsonian s udvar hazy center annex near washington dulles international airport in virginia
in 2009 the lunar reconnaissance orbiter imaged the various apollo landing sites on the surface of the moon with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules scientific instruments and foot trails made by the astronauts
in march 2012 amazon founder jeff bezos located the f 1 engines that launched apollo 11 into space
the engines were found below the atlantic ocean s surface through the use of advanced sonar scanning
his team plans to bring at least one of the five engines to the surface
additional details several books indicate early mission timelines had buzz aldrin rather than neil armstrong as the first man on the moon
40th anniversary events on july 15 2009 life com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by life photographer ralph morse prior to the apollo 11 launch
from july 16 – 24 2009 nasa streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred
in addition it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments
the john f kennedy library set up a flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of apollo 11 from launch to landing on the moon
a group of british scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the moon landing it was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken that would be inconceivable in the risk averse world of today the apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date nothing since apollo has come close to the excitement that was generated by those astronauts armstrong aldrin and the 10 others who followed them
on august 7 2009 an act of congress awarded the three astronauts a congressional gold medal the highest civilian award in the united states
the bill was sponsored by florida sen bill nelson and florida rep alan grayson
in july 2010 air to ground voice recordings and film footage shot in mission control during the apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re synchronised and released for the first time

apollo 8 the second manned mission in the united states apollo space program was launched on december 21 1968 and became the first manned space craft to leave earth orbit reach the earth s moon orbit it and return safely to earth
the three astronaut crew — commander frank borman command module pilot james lovell and lunar module pilot william anders — became the first humans to travel beyond low earth orbit the first to see earth as a whole planet and then the first to directly see the far side of the moon
the 1968 mission the third flight of the saturn v rocket and the first manned launch of the saturn v was also the first manned launch from the john f kennedy space center florida located adjacent to cape canaveral
originally planned as a second lunar module command module test in an elliptical medium earth orbit in early 1969 the mission profile was changed in august 1968 to a more ambitious command module only lunar orbital flight to be flown in december because the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight
this meant borman s crew was scheduled to fly two to three months sooner than originally planned leaving them a shorter time for training and preparation thus placing more demands than usual on their time and discipline
apollo 8 took three days to travel to the moon
it orbited ten times over the course of 20 hours during which the crew made a christmas eve television broadcast in which they read the first 10 verses from the book of genesis
at the time the broadcast was the most watched tv program ever
apollo 8 s successful mission paved the way for apollo 11 to fulfill u s president john f kennedy s goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s
the apollo 8 astronauts returned to earth on december 27 1968 when their space craft splashed down in the northern pacific ocean
crew this crew was unique among pre shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew
this was also the first case of the rarity of an astronaut who had flown as commander subsequently flying as a non commander as lovell had previously commanded gemini xii
backup crew on a lunar mission the command module pilot cmp was assigned the role of navigator while the lunar module pilot lmp was assigned the role of flight engineer responsible for monitoring all spacecraft systems even if the flight did n t include a lunar module
lovell was originally the cmp on the back up crew with michael collins as the prime crew s cmp
however collins was replaced in july 1968 after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair
edwin aldrin was originally the backup lmp
when lovell was rotated to the prime crew no one with experience on csm 103 the specific spacecraft used for the mission was available so aldrin was moved to cmp and fred haise brought in as backup lmp
neil armstrong went on to command apollo 11 where aldrin was returned to the lmp position and collins was assigned as cmp
mission control the earth based mission control teams for apollo 8 consisted of astronauts assigned to the support crew as well as non astronaut flight directors and their staffs
the support crew members were not trained to fly the mission but were able to stand in for astronauts in meetings and be involved in the minutiae of mission planning while the prime and backup crews trained
they also served as capcoms during the mission
for apollo 8 these crew members included astronauts john s bull vance d brand gerald p carr and ken mattingly
the mission control teams on earth rotated in three shifts each led by a flight director
the directors for apollo 8 included cliff charlesworth green team glynn lunney black team and milton windler maroon team
mission insignia the triangular shape of the insignia symbolizes the shape of the apollo command module
it shows a red figure 8 looping around the earth and moon representing the mission number as well as the circumlunar nature of the mission
on the red number 8 are the names of the three astronauts
the initial design of the insignia was developed by jim lovell
lovell reportedly sketched the initial design while riding in the backseat of a t 38 flight from california to houston shortly after learning of the re designation of the flight to become a lunar orbit al mission
the graphic design of the insignia was done by houston artist and animator william bradley
planning apollo 4 and apollo 6 had been a missions unmanned tests of the saturn v launch vehicle using an unmanned block i production model of the apollo command and service module in earth orbit
scheduled for october 1968 would be a manned earth orbit flight of the csm completing the objectives for mission c
further missions depended on the readiness of the lunar module lm
apollo 8 was planned as the d mission to test the lm in a low earth orbit in december 1968 by james mcdivitt david scott and russell schweickart while borman s crew would fly the e mission a more rigorous lm test in an elliptical medium earth orbit as apollo 9 in early 1969
but production of the lm fell behind schedule and when apollo 8 s lm arrived at cape canaveral in june 1968 significant defects were discovered leading grumman the lead contractor for the lm to predict that the first mission ready lm would not be ready until at least february 1969
this would mean delaying the d and subsequent missions endangering the program s goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969
george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office proposed a solution in august to keep the program on track despite the lm delay
since the command service module csm would be ready three months before the lunar module a csm only mission could be flown in december 1968
instead of just repeating the c mission flight of apollo 7 this csm could be sent all the way to the moon with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit
the new mission would also allow nasa to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have to wait until apollo 10 the scheduled f mission
this also meant that the medium earth orbit e mission could be dispensed with
the net result was that only the d mission had to be delayed
almost every senior manager at nasa agreed with this new mission citing both confidence in the hardware and personnel and the potential for a significant morale boost provided by a circumlunar flight
the only person who needed some convincing was james e webb the nasa administrator
with the rest of his agency in support of the new mission webb eventually approved the mission change
the mission was officially changed from a d mission to a c prime lunar orbit mission but was still referred to in press releases as an earth orbit mission at webb s direction
no public announcement was made about the change in mission until november 12 three weeks after apollo 7 s successful earth orbit mission and less than 40 days before launch
with the change in mission for apollo 8 director of flight crew operations deke slayton decided to swap the crews of the d and e missions
this swap also meant a swap of spacecraft requiring borman s crew to use csm 103 while mcdivitt s crew would use csm 104
on september 9 the crew entered the simulators to begin their preparation for the flight
by the time the mission flew the crew had spent seven hours training for every actual hour of flight
although all crew members were trained in all aspects of the mission it was necessary to specialize
borman as commander was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the re entry
lovell was trained on navigating the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the earth
anders was placed in charge of checking that the spacecraft was in working order
added pressure on the apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the soviet union s flight of some living creatures including russian tortoise s in a cislunar loop around the moon on zond 5 and return to earth on september 21
there was speculation within nasa and the press that they might be preparing to launch cosmonauts on a similar circumlunar mission before the end of 1968
the apollo 8 crew now living in the crew quarters at kennedy space center received a visit from charles lindbergh and his wife anne morrow lindbergh the night before the launch
they talked about how before his 1927 flight lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from new york city to paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight
the total was a tenth of the amount that the saturn v would burn every second
the next day the lindberghs watched the launch of apollo 8 from a nearby dune
saturn v the saturn v rocket used by apollo 8 was designated sa 503 or the 03rd model of the saturn v 5 rocket to be used in the saturn apollo sa program
when it was erected in the vertical assembly building on december 20 1967 it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned earth orbit test flight carrying a boilerplate command service module
apollo 6 had suffered several major problems during its april 1968 flight including severe pogo oscillation during its first stage two second stage engine failures and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit
without assurances that these problems had been rectified nasa administrators could not justify risking a manned mission until additional unmanned test flights proved that the saturn v was ready
teams from the marshall space flight center msfc went to work on the problems
of primary concern was the pogo oscillation which would not only hamper engine performance but could exert significant g forces on a crew
a task force of contractors nasa agency representatives and msfc researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket
a system using helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed
of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight
researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two
when an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two it accidentally shut down engine three s liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection
as a result engine three failed within one second of engine two s shutdown
further investigation revealed the same problem for the third stage engine — a faulty igniter line
the team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches
the teams tested their solutions in august 1968 at the marshall space flight center
a saturn stage ic was equipped with shock absorbing devices to demonstrate the team s solution to the problem of pogo oscillation while a saturn stage ii was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions
once nasa administrators were convinced that the problems were solved they gave their approval for a manned mission using sa 503
the apollo 8 spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on september 21 and the rocket made the slow 3 mile 5 km journey to the launch pad on october 9
testing continued all through december until the day before launch including various levels of readiness testing from december 5 through 11
final testing of modifications to address the problems of pogo oscillation ruptured fuel lines and bad igniter lines took place on december 18 a mere three days before the scheduled launch
mission parameter summary as the first manned spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body apollo 8 s profile had two different sets of orbital parameters separated by a translunar injection maneuver
apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal circular earth parking orbit
apollo 8 was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of and a perigee of with an inclination of 32 51 ° to the equator and an orbital period of 88 19 minutes
propellant venting increased the apogee by over the 2 hours 44 minutes and 30 seconds spent in the parking orbit
this was followed by a trans lunar injection tli burn of the s ivb third stage for 318 seconds accelerating the spacecraft from an orbital velocity of to the injection velocity of which set a record for the highest speed relative to earth that humans had ever traveled
this speed was slightly less than the earth s escape velocity of but put apollo 8 into an elongated elliptical earth orbit to a point where the moon s gravity would capture it
the standard lunar orbit for apollo missions was planned as a nominal circular orbit above the moon s surface
initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a perilune of and an apolune of at an inclination of 12 ° from the lunar equator
this was then circularized at by with an orbital period of 128 7 minutes
the effect of lunar mass concentrations masscons on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted over the course of the twenty hour mission the orbit was perturbated to by
apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from earth of
launch and trans lunar injection apollo 8 launched at 7 51 00 a m eastern standard time on december 21 1968 using the saturn v s three stages s ic s ii and s ivb to achieve earth orbit
the launch phase experienced only three minor problems the engines of the first stage s ic underperformed by 0 75 causing the engines to burn for 2 45 seconds longer than planned and toward the end of the second stage burn s ii the rocket underwent pogo oscillation s frank borman estimated the oscillations were approximately and ± 2 5 m s2
all three rocket stages fired during launch the s ic and s ii detached during launch
the s ic impacted the atlantic ocean at and the s ii second stage at
the third stage of the rocket s ivb assisted in driving the craft into earth orbit but remained attached to later perform the tli burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon
once in earth orbit both the apollo 8 crew and mission control spent the next 2 hours and 38 minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for tli
the proper operation of third stage of the rocket s ivb was crucial in the last unmanned test the s ivb had failed to re ignite for tli
during the flight three fellow astronauts served on the ground as capsule communicator s usually referred to as capcoms on a rotating schedule
the capcoms were the only people who regularly communicated with the crew
michael collins was the first capcom on duty and at 2 hours 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch radioed apollo 8
you are go for tli
this communication signified that mission control had given official permission for apollo 8 to go to the moon
over the next 12 minutes before the tli burn the apollo 8 crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the s ivb
the engine ignited on time and performed the tli burn perfectly
after the s ivb had performed its required tasks it was jettisoned
the crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it
as the crew rotated the spacecraft they had their first views of the earth as they moved away from it
this marked the first time humans could view the whole earth at once
borman became worried that the s ivb was staying too close to the command service module and suggested to mission control that the crew perform a separation maneuver
mission control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards earth and using the reaction control system rcs thrusters on the service module to add away from the earth but borman did not want to lose sight of the s ivb
after discussion the crew and mission control decided to burn in this direction but at instead
these discussions put the crew an hour behind their flight plan
five hours after launch mission control sent a command to the s ivb booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change the booster s trajectory
this s ivb would then pass the moon and enter into a solar orbit posing no further hazard to apollo 8
the s ivb subsequently went into a solar orbit with an inclination of 23 47 ° from the plane of the ecliptic and an orbital period of 340 80 days
the apollo 8 crew were the first humans to pass through the van allen radiation belt s which extend up to from earth
scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecraft s high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest x ray or 1 milligray during the course of a year the average human receives a dose of 2 to 3 mgy
to record the actual radiation dosages each crew member wore a personal radiation dosimeter that transmitted data to earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew
by the end of the mission the crew experienced an average radiation dose of 1 6 mgy
lunar trajectory jim lovell s main job as command module pilot was as navigator
although mission control performed all of the actual navigation calculations it was necessary to have a crew member serving as navigator so that the crew could successfully return to earth in case of communication loss with mission control
lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft measuring the angle between a star and the earth s or the moon s horizon
this task proved to be difficult as a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft formed by the venting s ivb made it hard to distinguish the stars
by seven hours into the mission the crew was about one hour and 40 minutes behind flight plan due to the issues of moving away from the s ivb and lovell s obscured star sightings
the crew now placed the spacecraft into passive thermal control ptc also known as barbecue roll
ptc involved the spacecraft rotating about once per hour along its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft
in direct sunlight the spacecraft could be heated to over while the parts in shadow would be
these temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack or propellant lines to burst
as it was impossible to get a perfect roll the spacecraft actually swept out a cone as it rotated
the crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger
the first mid course correction came 11 hours into the flight
testing on the ground had shown that the service propulsion system sps engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first
burning the engine for a short period would accomplish coating
this first correction burn was only 2 4 seconds and added about velocity prograde in the direction of travel
this change was less than the planned due to a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines causing lower than expected fuel pressure
the crew had to use the small reaction control system rcs thrusters to make up the shortfall
two later planned mid course corrections were canceled as the apollo 8 trajectory was found to be perfect
11 hours into the flight the crew had been awake for over 16 hours
before launch nasa had decided that at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise
borman started the first sleep shift but between the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises he found sleep difficult
about an hour after starting his sleep shift borman requested clearance to take a seconal sleeping pill
however the pill had little effect
borman eventually fell asleep but then awoke feeling ill
he vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces that the crew cleaned up to the best of their ability
borman initially decided that he did not want everyone to know about his medical problems but lovell and anders wanted to inform mission control
the crew decided to use the data storage equipment dse which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to mission control at high speed
after recording a description of borman s illness they requested that mission control check the recording stating that they would like an evaluation of the voice comments
the apollo 8 crew and mission control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second floor control room there were two identical control rooms in houston on the second and third floor only one of which was used during a mission
the conference participants decided that there was little to worry about and that borman s illness was either a 24 hour flu as borman thought or a reaction to the sleeping pill
researchers now believe that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness
space adaptation syndrome had not been an issue on previous spacecraft mercury and gemini as those astronauts were unable to move freely in the comparatively smaller cabins of those spacecraft
the increased cabin space in the apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement contributing to symptoms of spacesickness for borman and later astronaut russell schweickart during apollo 9
the cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course
during this time nasa scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch
the apollo 8 crew used a 2 kg camera that broadcast in black and white only using a vidicon tube
the camera had two lenses a very wide angle 160 ° lens and a telephoto 9 ° lens
during this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the earth appeared from space
however difficulties aiming the narrow angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the earth impossible
additionally the earth image became saturated by any bright source without proper filters
in the end all the crew could show the people watching back on earth was a bright blob
after broadcasting for 17 minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the high gain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday
by this time the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts
lovell went to sleep 32 ½ hours into the flight — 3 ½ hours before he had planned to
a short while later anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill
the crew was unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise
two factors made the moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft three of the five windows fogging up due to out gassed oils from the silicone sealant and the attitude required for the ptc
it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time
the apollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the flight
this time the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the earth through the telephoto lens
although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth
the crew spent the transmission describing the earth and what was visible and the colors they could see
the transmission lasted 23 minutes
lunar sphere of influence at about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight the crew of apollo 8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body
in other words the effect of the moon s gravitational force on apollo 8 became stronger than that of the earth
at the time it happened apollo 8 was from the moon and had a speed of relative to the moon
this historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at kennedy space center
they would continue to do so until they performed their last mid course correction switching to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit
it was only 13 hours until they would be in lunar orbit
the last major event before lunar orbit insertion was a second mid course correction
it was in retrograde against direction of travel and slowed the spacecraft down by effectively lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon
at exactly 61 hours after launch about from the moon the crew burned the rcs for 11 seconds
they would now pass from the lunar surface
at 64 hours into the flight the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit insertion 1 loi 1
this maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the moon out of contact with the earth
after mission control was polled for a go no go decision the crew was told at 68 hours they were go and riding the best bird we can find
at 68 hours and 58 minutes the spacecraft went behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth
with 10 minutes before the loi 1 the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place
at that time they finally got their first glimpses of the moon
they had been flying over the unlit side and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight ly illuminating the lunar surface
the loi burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view
lunar orbit the sps ignited at 69 hours 8 minutes and 16 seconds after launch and burned for 4 minutes and 13 seconds placing the apollo 8 spacecraft in orbit around the moon
the crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives
if the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even flung off into space
if it lasted too long they could have impacted the moon
after making sure the spacecraft was working they finally had a chance to look at the moon which they would orbit for the next 20 hours
on earth mission control continued to wait
if the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would appear early from behind the moon
however this time came and went without apollo 8 reappearing
exactly at the calculated moment the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a orbit about the moon
after reporting on the status of the spacecraft lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over
one of the crew s major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on the moon especially one in mare tranquillitatis that would be the apollo 11 landing site
the launch time of apollo 8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site
a film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record a frame every second of the moon below
bill anders spent much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest
by the end of the mission the crew had taken 700 photographs of the moon and 150 of the earth
throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with earth borman kept asking how the data for the sps looked
he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary
he also asked that they receive a go no go decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit
as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon the crew set up the equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface
anders described the craters that they were passing over
at the end of this second orbit they performed the 11 second loi 2 burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to
through the next two orbits the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the moon
during the third pass borman read a small prayer for his church
he had been scheduled to participate in a service at st christopher s episcopal church near seabrook texas but due to the apollo 8 flight was unable
a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control rod rose suggested that borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service
in the foreword to the millennial edition of his novel 2001 a space odyssey arthur c clarke says that crew told him they had been tempted to radio back the discovery of a large black monolith but discretion prevailed
earthrise when the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front the crew witnessed earthrise for the first time in human history nasa s lunar orbiter 1 took the very first picture of an earthrise from the vicinity of the moon on august 23 1966
borman saw the earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others taking a black and white photo as he did so
in the ensuing scramble anders took the more famous color photo later picked by life magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century
due to the synchronous rotation of the moon about the earth earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface
earthrise is generally only visible when orbiting the moon other than at selected places near the moon s where libration carries the earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon
anders continued to take photographs while lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so borman could rest
despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft borman was able to sleep for two orbits awakening periodically to ask questions about their status
borman awoke fully however when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes
they were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated
borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having not had a good night s sleep in over three days
taking command he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed
at first anders protested saying that he was fine but borman would not be swayed
at last anders agreed as long as borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the moon
borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert
for the next two orbits anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm
on subsequent apollo missions crews would avoid this situation by sleeping on the same schedule
as they rounded the moon for the ninth time the second television transmission began
borman introduced the crew followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the moon
borman described it as being a vast lonely forbidding expanse of nothing
then after talking about what they were flying over anders said that the crew had a message for all those on earth
each man on board read a section from the biblical creation story verses 1 10 from the book of genesis
borman finished the broadcast by wishing a merry christmas to everyone on earth
his message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit
borman said and from the crew of apollo 8 we close with good night good luck a merry christmas and god bless all of you all of you on the good earth
the only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the trans earth injection tei which was scheduled for 2 ½ hours after the end of the television transmission
the tei was the most critical burn of the flight as any failure of the sps to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit with little hope of escape
as with the previous burn the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the moon out of contact with earth
the burn occurred exactly on time
the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re emerged from behind the moon at 89 hours 28 minutes and 39 seconds the exact time calculated
when voice contact was regained lovell announced please be informed there is a santa claus to which ken mattingly the current capcom replied that s affirmative you are the best ones to know
the spacecraft began its journey back to earth on december 25 christmas day
unplanned manual re alignment later lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard
however he accidentally erased some of the computer s memory which caused the inertial measuring unit imu to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift off and fire the thrusters to correct the module s attitude
once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module s attitude they realized they would have to re enter data that would tell the computer its real position
it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned and another 15 minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer
16 months later lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re alignment under more critical conditions during the apollo 13 mission after that module s imu had to be turned off to conserve energy
in his 1994 book lost moon the perilous voyage of apollo 13 lovell wrote my training on apollo 8 came in handy
in that book he dismissed the incident as a planned experiment requested by the ground crew
in subsequent interviews lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident caused by his mistake
cruise back to earth and re entry the cruise back to earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft
as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly the spacecraft would re enter two and half days after tei and splash down in the pacific
on christmas afternoon the crew made their fifth television broadcast
this time they gave a tour of the spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space
when they finished broadcasting they found a small present from deke slayton in the food locker a real turkey dinner with stuffing in the same kind of pack that the troops in vietnam received
another slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature bottles of brandy that borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed
they remained unopened even years after the flight
there were also small presents to the crew from their wives
the next day at about 124 hours into the mission the sixth and final tv transmission showed the mission s best video images of the earth in a four minute broadcast
after two uneventful days the crew prepared for re entry
the computer would control the re entry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude blunt end forward
if the computer broke down borman would take over
once the command module was separated from the service module the astronauts were committed to re entry
six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere the crew saw the moon rising above the earth s horizon just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists
as they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the spacecraft
the spacecraft started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at 6 g 59 m s2
with the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the spacecraft apollo 8 rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean
at the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at by the three main parachutes
the spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as in the north pacific ocean south of hawaii
when it hit the water the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down in what was termed stable 2 position
about six minutes later the command module was righted into its normal apex up splashdown orientation by the inflatable bag uprighting system
as they were buffeted by a swell borman was sick waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft
it was 43 minutes after splashdown before the first frogman from the uss yorktown arrived as the spacecraft had landed before sunrise
forty five minutes later the crew was safe on the deck of the aircraft carrier
historical importance apollo 8 came at the end of 1968 a year that had seen much upheaval in the united states and most of the world
even though the year saw political assassinations political unrest in the streets of europe and america and the prague spring time magazine chose the crew of apollo 8 as their men of the year for 1968 recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year
they had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the earth and orbit another celestial body
they had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a fifty fifty chance of fully succeeding
the effect of apollo 8 can be summed up by a telegram from a stranger received by borman after the mission that simply stated thank you apollo 8
you saved 1968
one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon
this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture whilst actually behind the camera and it has been credited with a role in inspiring the first earth day in 1970
it was selected as the first of life magazine s hundred photos that changed the world
apollo 11 astronaut michael collins said eight s momentous historic significance was foremost while many space historians such as robert k poole see apollo 8 as the most historically significant of all the apollo missions
the mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first american orbital flight mercury atlas 6 by john glenn in 1962
there were 1200 journalists covering the mission with the bbc coverage being broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages
the soviet newspaper pravda featured a quote from boris nikolaevich petrov chairman of the soviet intercosmos program who described the flight as an outstanding achievement of american space sciences and technology
it is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw — either live or delayed — the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon
the apollo 8 broadcasts won an emmy award the highest honor given by the academy of television arts and sciences
atheist madalyn murray o hair later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis
o hair wished the courts to ban us astronauts — who were all government employees — from public prayer in space
though the case was rejected by the us supreme court for lack of jurisdiction it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program
buzz aldrin on apollo 11 self communicated presbyterian communion on the surface of the moon after landing he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and only obliquely referred to it at the time
in 1969 the us postal service issued a postage stamp scott 1371 commemorating the apollo 8 flight around the moon
the stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the earthrise over the moon taken by anders on christmas eve and the words in the beginning god just 18 days after the crew s return to earth they were featured during the 1969 super bowl pre game show reciting the pledge of allegiance prior to the national anthem
spacecraft location the command module is now displayed at the chicago museum of science and industry along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by lovell and the spacesuit worn by frank borman
jim lovell s apollo 8 spacesuit is on public display in the visitor center at nasa s glenn research center
bill anders spacesuit is on display at the science museum in london england
in film apollo 8 s historic mission has been shown and referred to in several forms both documentary and fiction
the various television transmissions and 16 mm footage shot by the crew of apollo 8 was compiled and released by nasa in the 1969 documentary debrief apollo 8 which was hosted by burgess meredith
in addition spacecraft films released in 2003 a three disc dvd set containing all of nasa s tv and 16mm film footage related to the mission including all tv transmissions from space training and launch footage and motion pictures taken in flight
portions of the apollo 8 mission can be seen in the 1989 documentary for all mankind which won the grand jury prize at the sundance film festival for outstanding documentary
the apollo 8 mission was well covered in the british documentary in the shadow of the moon
portions of the apollo 8 mission are dramatized in the miniseries from the earth to the moon episode 1968
the s ivb stage of apollo 8 was also portrayed as the location of an alien device in the 1970 ufo episode conflict
at the kennedy space center visitor complex s apollo saturn v center the history of the u s space program leading up to the launch of apollo 8 is the subject of a multi screen multimedia presentation which also features the actual control panels used in the firing room for the launch

an astronaut or cosmonaut is a person trained by a human spaceflight program to command pilot or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft
while generally reserved for professional space travelers the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space including scientists politicians journalists and tourists
until 2002 astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments either by the military or by civilian space agencies
with the sub orbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in 2004 a new category of astronaut was created the commercial astronaut
definition the criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary
the fédération aéronautique internationale fai sporting code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed an altitude of
in the united states professional military and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of are awarded astronaut wings
as of june 20 2011 a total of 654 people from 38 countries have reached or more in altitude of which 520 reached low earth orbit or beyond
of these 24 people have traveled beyond low earth orbit to either lunar or trans lunar orbit or to the surface of the moon three of the 24 did so twice jim lovell john young and eugene cernan
the three astronauts who have not reached low earth orbit are spaceplane pilots joe walker mike melvill and brian binnie
under the u s definition as of june 20 2011 529 people qualify as having reached space above altitude
of eight x 15 pilots who exceeded in altitude only one exceeded 100 kilometers about 62 miles
space travelers have spent over 30 400 man days 83 man years in space including over 100 astronaut days of spacewalks
as of 2008 the man with the longest cumulative time in space is sergei k krikalev who has spent 803 days 9 hours and 39 minutes or 2 2 years in space
peggy a whitson holds the record for the most time in space by a woman 377 days
terminology english in english speaking nations a professional space traveler is called an astronaut
the term derives from the greek words ástron ἄστρον meaning star and nautes ναύτης meaning sailor
the first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by neil r jones in his short story the death s head meteor in 1930
the word itself had been known earlier
for example in percy greg s 1880 book across the zodiac astronaut referred to a spacecraft
in les navigateurs de l infini 1925 of j h rosny aîné the word astronautique astronautic was used
the word may have been inspired by aeronaut an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to balloon ists
an early use in a non fiction publication is eric frank russell s poem the astronaut in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary society
the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year
nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond
nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut corps
the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut corps russian by convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency or its soviet predecessor is called a cosmonaut in english texts
the word is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt one who works in space outside the earth s atmosphere a space traveler which derives from the greek words kosmos κόσμος meaning universe and nautes ναύτης meaning sailor
the soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin was the first cosmonaut — indeed the first person — in space
valentina tereshkova a russian factory worker was the first woman in space as well as arguably the first civilian to make it there see below for a further discussion of civilians in space
on march 14 1995 norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle and thus became the first american cosmonaut
chinese official english language texts issued by the government of the people s republic of china use astronaut while texts in russian use космонавт cosmonaut
in official chinese language texts yǔ háng yuán space navigating personnel are used for astronaut and cosmonaut and háng tiān yuán space navigating personnel is specially used for chinese astronaut
the phrase tài kōng rén spaceman is often used in taiwan and hong kong the term taikonaut is used by some english language news media organizations for professional space travelers from china
the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries the latter of which describes it as a hybrid of the chinese term taikong space and the greek naut sailor the term became more common in 2003 when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou 5 spacecraft
this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese people s daily since the advent of the chinese space program
the origin of the term is unclear as early as may 1998 chiew lee yih from malaysia used it in newsgroup s other terms with the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies
while no nation other than the russian federation and previously the former soviet union the united states and china have launched a manned spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries
inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage
for example the term spationaut french spelling spationaute is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word spatium for space and the malay term angkasawan was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program
space travel milestones the first human in space was soviet yuri gagarin who was launched on april 12 1961 aboard vostok 1 and orbited around the earth for 108 minutes

on july 23 1980 pham tuan of vietnam became the first asian in space when he flew aboard soyuz 37
also in 1980 cuban arnaldo tamayo méndez became the first person of hispanic and black african descent to fly in space and guion bluford became the first african american to fly into space
the first person born in africa to fly in space was patrick baudry in 1985
in 1985 saudi arabian prince sultan bin salman bin abdulaziz al saud became the first arab muslim astronaut in space
in 1988 abdul ahad mohmand became the first afghan to reach space spending nine days aboard the mir space station
with the larger number of seats available on the space shuttle the u s began taking international astronauts
in 1983 ulf merbold of west germany became the first non us citizen to fly in a us spacecraft in 1984 marc garneau became the first of 8 canadian astronauts to fly in space through 2010
in 1985 rodolfo neri vela became the first mexican born person in space
in 1991 helen sharman became the first briton to fly in space
in 2002 mark shuttleworth became the first citizen of an african country to fly in space as a paying spaceflight participant
in 2003 ilan ramon became the first israeli to fly in space although he died during a re entry accident
age milestones the youngest person to fly in space is gherman titov who was 25 years old when he flew vostok 2 titov was also the first person to suffer space sickness the oldest person who has flown in space is john glenn who was 77 when he flew on sts 95
duration and distance milestones the longest stay in space thus far has been 438 days by russian valeri polyakov
as of 2006 the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven a record held by both jerry l ross and franklin chang diaz the farthest distance from earth an astronaut has traveled was when jim lovell jack swigert and fred haise went around the moon during the apollo 13 emergency
civilian and non government milestones depending on the exact definition of civilian the first civilian in space was either valentina tereshkova aboard vostok 6 she also became the first woman in space on that mission or joseph albert walker on x 15 flight 90 a month later
tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the ussr s air force which had no female pilots whatsoever at that time joe walker had joined the us army air force but was not a member during his flight
the first people in space who had never been a member of any country s armed forces were both konstantin feoktistov and boris yegorov aboard voskhod 1
the first non governmental space traveler was byron k lichtenberg a researcher from the massachusetts institute of technology who flew on sts 9 in 1983
in december 1990 toyohiro akiyama became the first paying space traveler as a reporter for tokyo broadcasting system a visit to mir as part of an estimated 12 million usd deal with a japanese tv station although at the time the term used to refer to akiyama was research cosmonaut
akiyama suffered severe space sickness during his mission which affected his productivity
the first self funded space tourist was dennis tito on board the russian spacecraft soyuz tm 3 on 28 april 2001
self funded travelers the first person to fly on an entirely privately funded mission was mike melvill piloting spaceshipone flight 15p on a suborbital journey although he was a test pilot employed by scaled composites and not an actual paying space tourist
seven others have paid to fly into space training the first nasa astronauts were selected for training in 1959
early in the space program military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at nasa although neither john glenn nor scott carpenter of the mercury seven had any university degree in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection
selection was initially limited to military pilots
the earliest astronauts for both america and the ussr tended to be jet fighter pilots and were often test pilots
once selected nasa astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas including training for extra vehicular activity in a facility such as nasa s neutral buoyancy laboratory
astronauts in training may also experience short periods of weightlessness in aircraft called the vomit comet the nickname given to a pair of modified kc 135 s retired in 2000 and 2004 respectively and replaced in 2005 with a c 9 which perform parabolic flights
astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high performance jet aircraft
this is mostly done in t 38 jet aircraft out of ellington field due to its proximity to the johnson space center
ellington field is also where the shuttle training aircraft is maintained and developed although most flights of the aircraft are done out of edwards air force base
nasa candidacy requirements commander and pilot mission specialist mission specialist educator mission specialist educators or educator astronauts were first selected in 2004 and as of 2007 there are three nasa educator astronauts joseph m acaba richard r arnold and dorothy metcalf lindenburger
barbara morgan selected as back up teacher to christa mcauliffe in 1985 is considered to be the first educator astronaut by the media but she trained as a mission specialist
the educator astronaut program is a successor to the teacher in space program from the 1980s
health risks of space travel astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness barotrauma immunodeficiencies loss of bone and muscle loss of eyesight orthostatic intolerance due to volume loss sleep disturbances and radiation injury
a variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the national space and biomedical research institute nsbri to address these issues
prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts including former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space
this study s techniques are now being applied to cover professional and olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non expert operators in medical and high school students
it is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is often rare
on december 31 2012 a nasa supported study reported that manned spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of alzheimer s disease
insignia in russia cosmonauts are awarded pilot cosmonaut of the russian federation upon completion of their missions often accompanied with the award of hero of the russian federation
this follows the practice established in the soviet union
at nasa those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver lapel pin
once they have flown in space they receive a gold pin
u s astronauts who also have active duty military status receive a special qualification badge known as the astronaut badge after participation on a spaceflight
the united states air force also presents an astronaut badge to its pilots who exceed in altitude
deaths eighteen astronauts fourteen men and four women have lost their lives during four space flights
by nationality thirteen were american including one of indian origin four were russian soviet union and one was israeli
eleven people all men have lost their lives training for spaceflight eight americans and three russians
six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft one drowned during water recovery training and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments
the space mirror memorial which stands on the grounds of the john f kennedy space center visitor complex commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the united states
in addition to twenty nasa career astronauts the memorial includes the names of a u s air force x 15 test pilot a u s air force officer who died while training for a then classified military space program and a civilian spaceflight participant

a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being a burden to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the public commonly referred to as a modest proposal is a juvenalian satirical essay written and published anonymously by jonathan swift in 1729
swift suggests that the impoverished irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies
this satirical hyperbole mocks heartless attitudes towards the poor as well as irish policy in general
in english writing the phrase a modest proposal is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight faced satire
details swift goes to great lengths to support his argument including a list of possible preparation styles for the children and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion
he uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon then influential william petty and the social engineering popular among followers of francis bacon
these lampoons include appealing to the authority of a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london and the famous psalmanazar a native of the island formosa who had already confessed to not being from formosa in 1706
this essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the english language
much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in ireland so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of swift s solution when he states a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stew ed roasted baked or boiled and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout
readers unacquainted with its reputation as a satirical work often do not immediately realize that swift was not seriously proposing cannibalism and infanticide nor would readers unfamiliar with the satires of horace and juvenal recognize that swift s essay follows the rules and structure of latin satire s the satirical element of the pamphlet is often only understood after the reader notes the allusions made by swift to the attitudes of landlords such as the following i grant this food may be somewhat dear and therefore very proper for landlords who as they have already devoured most of the parents seem to have the best title to the children
swift extends the conceit to get in a few jibes at england ’s mistreatment of ireland noting that for this kind of commodity will not bear exportation and flesh being of too tender a consistence to admit a long continuance in salt although perhaps i could name a country which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it
in the tradition of roman satire swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by paralipsis population solutions george wittkowsky argued that swift ’s main target in a modest proposal was not the conditions in ireland but rather the can do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills
swift was especially insulted by projects that tried to fix population and labor issues with a simple cure all solution
a memorable example of these sorts of schemes involved the idea of running the poor through a joint stock company
in response swift ’s modest proposal was a burlesque of projects concerning the poor that were in vogue during the early 18th century
a modest proposal also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects
the pamphlet targets reformers who regard people as commodities
in the piece swift adopts the technique of a political arithmetician to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics
critics differ about swift ’s intentions in using this faux mathematical philosophy
edmund wilson argues that statistically the logic of the modest proposal can be compared with defense of crime arrogated to marx in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population
wittkowsky counters that swift s satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that springs from a spirit of bitter mockery not from the delight in calculations for their own sake
rhetoric charles k smith argues that swift ’s rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the irish
swift ’s specific strategy is twofold using a trap to create sympathy for the irish and a dislike of the narrator who in the span of one sentence details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty but feels emotion solely for members of his own class
swift ’s use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator ’s cool approach towards them create two opposing points of view that alienate the reader perhaps unconsciously from a narrator who can view with melancholy detachment a subject that swift has directed us rhetorically to see in a much less detached way
swift has his proposer further degrade the irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals
lewis argues that the speaker uses the vocabulary of animal husbandry to describe the irish
once the children have been commodified swift ’s rhetoric can easily turn people into animals then meat and from meat logically into tonnage worth a price per pound
swift uses the proposer ’s serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal
in making his argument the speaker uses the conventional text book approved order of argument from swift ’s time which was derived from the latin rhetorician quintilian
the contrast between the careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme and the ridiculousness of the proposal create a situation in which the reader has to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent thoughtful and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan
influences there has been some scholarship about what other writings influenced swift to write a modest proposal
tertullian ’s apology james johnson argued that a modest proposal was largely influenced and inspired by tertullian ’s apology a satirical attack against early roman persecution of christianity
james william johnson believes that swift saw major similarities between the two situations
johnson notes swift ’s obvious affinity for tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works a modest proposal and apology
in structure johnson points out the same central theme that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument that human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human
stylistically swift and tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language
in agreement with johnson donald c baker points out the similarity between both authors tones and use of irony
baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic justification by ownership over the subject of sacrificing children — tertullian while attacking pagan parents and swift while attacking the english mistreatment of the irish poor
defoe s the generous projector it has also been argued that a modest proposal was at least in part a response to the 1728 essay the generous projector or a friendly proposal to prevent murder and other enormous abuses by erecting an hospital for foundlings and bastard children by swift s rival daniel defoe
economic themes robert phiddian s article have you eaten yet
the reader in a modest proposal focuses on two aspects of a modest proposal the voice of swift and the voice of the proposer
phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satiric voice of jonathan swift and the apparent economic projections of the proposer
he reminds readers that there is a gap between the narrator ’s meaning and the text ’s and that a moral political argument is being carried out by means of parody
while swift ’s proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal george wittkowsky author of swift ’s modest proposal the biography of an early georgian pamphlet argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of swift ’s time
wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labor in 18th century england
i f one regards the modest proposal simply as a criticism of condition about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that swift s irony brilliantly underscored this fact
people are the riches of a nation at the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century it was believed that people are the riches of the nation and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less
furthermore in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry
in those times the somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity
louis a landa presents swift ’s a modest proposal as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that people are the riches of a nation
swift presents the dire state of ireland and shows that mere population itself in ireland ’s case did not always mean greater wealth and economy
the uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer not richer
swift also recognizes the implications of such a fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens
swift however landa argues is not merely criticizing economic maxims but also addressing the fact that england was denying irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanizing them by viewing them as a mere commodity
modern usage a modest proposal is included in many literature programs as an example of early modern western satire
it also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language lending itself well to secondary and post secondary essay courses
outside of the realm of english studies a modest proposal is a relevant piece included in many comparative and global literature and history courses as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts humanities and even the social sciences
the essay has been emulated many times
in his book a modest proposal 1984 evangelical author frank schaeffer emulated swift s work in social conservative polemic against abortion and euthanasia in a future dystopia that advocated recycling of aborted embryos and fetuses as well as some disabled infants with compound intellectual physical and physiological difficulties
such baby doe rules cases were then a major concern of the pro life movement of the early 1980s which viewed selective treatment of those infants as disability discrimination

the alkali metals are a group in the periodic table consisting of the chemical element s lithium li sodium na potassium k rubidium rb caesium cs and francium fr
this group lies in the s block of the periodic table as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s orbital
the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting well characterized homologous behaviour
the alkali metals have very similar properties they are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cation s with charge 1
they can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation
because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free element
in the modern iupac nomenclature the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements excluding hydrogen h which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals
all the alkali metals react with water with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones
all the discovered alkali metals occur in nature in order of abundance sodium is the most abundant followed by potassium lithium rubidium caesium and finally francium which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity and thus occurs only in traces due to its presence in natural decay chain s experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium uue which is likely to be the next member of the group but they have all met with failure
however ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy element s even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues
most alkali metals have many different applications
two of the most well known applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium atomic clock s of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time
a common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium vapour lamp which emits very efficient light
table salt or sodium chloride has been used since antiquity
sodium and potassium are also essential element s having major biological roles as electrolyte s and although the other alkali metals are not essential they also have various effects on the body both beneficial and harmful
characteristics chemical like other groups the known members of this family show patterns in its electronic configuration especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group
the chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity thus the presentation of its properties here is limited
all the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature
because of this they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene paraffin oil
they react aggressively with the halogen s to form the alkali metal halide s which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride li f
the alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkali ne hydroxide s and thus should be handled with great care
the heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones for example when dropped into water caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium
the alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron
the second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus thus they almost always lose a single electron forming cations
the alkalide s are an exception they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a − 1 oxidation state which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anion s and were thought to be able to appear in salts only as cations
the alkalide anions have filled s subshells which gives them more stability and allows them to exist
all the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials
alkalides are chemically similar to the electride s which are salts with trapped electron s acting as anions
a particularly striking example of an alkalide is inverse sodium hydride h n a − as opposed to the usual sodium hydride na h − it is unstable in isolation due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium although several derivatives are predicted to be metastable or stable
the chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small li cation polarises anion s and gives its compounds a more covalent character
lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship because of this lithium has some similarities to magnesium
for example lithium forms a stable nitride a property common among all the alkaline earth metal s magnesium s group but unique among the alkali metals
in addition among their respective groups only lithium and magnesium form covalent organometallic compound s e g li me and mgme2
lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is not soluble in water and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent
francium is also predicted show some differences due to its high atomic weight causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent
in contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals francium s electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesium s due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons also its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low
compounds and reactions reaction with water alkali metal hydroxides all the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water producing an aqueous solution of the strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas
this reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group lithium reacts steadily with effervescence but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers
when an alkali metal is dropped into water it produces an explosion of which there are two separate stages
the metal reacts with the water first breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals
second the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air
this secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water lake or other body of water not the initial reaction of the metal with water which tends to happen mostly under water
the chemical reaction of the alkali metals with water is reaction with nitrogen alkali metal nitrides lithium the lightest of the alkali metals is the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen at standard conditions and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride
nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule n2 requires a lot of energy
the formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal forming m ions the energy required to break the triple bond in n2 and the formation of n3 − ions and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride
the lattice energy is maximised with small highly charged ions the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions only forming ions with a charge of 1 so only lithium the smallest alkali metal can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic forming lithium nitride
the reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions
sodium nitride na3n and potassium nitride k3n while existing are extremely unstable being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements and can not be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions
the chemical reaction of lithium with nitrogen is reaction with oxygen alkali metal oxides all the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen at standard conditions
they form various types of oxides such as simple oxide s containing the o2 − ion peroxide s containing the ion where there is a single bond between the two oxygen atoms superoxide s containing the ion and many others
lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide
potassium forms a mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively
their reactivity increases going down the group while lithium sodium and potassium merely burn in air rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric spontaneously catch fire in air
the smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the more complex anions the peroxide and superoxide due to their small size
this attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom
this causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature
this effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium allowing them to form the less stable peroxides
rubidium and caesium at the bottom of the group are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form
because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised
the oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions
the chemical reaction of the alkali metals with oxygen that forms the oxide is the chemical reaction that forms the peroxide is the chemical reaction that forms the superoxide is rubidium and caesium can form even more complicated oxides than the superoxides
rubidium can form rb6o and rb9o2 upon oxidation in air while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides such as the ozonide cso3 and several brightly coloured suboxide s such as dark green cso as well as
the latter may be heated under vacuum to generate
reaction with the halogens alkali metal halides the alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table the halogen s forming salts known as the alkali metal halides
this includes sodium chloride otherwise known as common salt
the reactivity becomes higher from lithium to caesium and drops from fluorine to iodine
all of the alkali metal halides have the formula mx where m is an alkali metal and x is a halogen
they are all white ionic crystalline solids
all the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride lif which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy
the high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the li and f − ions causing the electrostatic interaction s between them to be strong
the chemical reaction of the alkali metals with the halogens is physical the alkali metals are all silver coloured except for caesium which has a golden tint
all are soft and have low densities melting point s and boiling point s the table below is a summary of the key physical and atomic properties of the alkali metals
data marked with question marks are either uncertain or are estimations partially based on periodic trends rather than observations
nuclear all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers hence their isotopes must be either odd odd both proton and neutron number are odd or odd even proton number is odd but neutron number is even
odd odd nuclei have even mass number s while odd even nuclei have odd mass numbers
odd odd primordial nuclide s are rare because most odd odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay because the decay products are even even and are therefore more strongly bound due to nuclear pairing effects
due to the great rarity of odd odd nuclei almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd even the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium 6 and the long lived radioisotope potassium 40
for a given odd mass number there can be only a single beta stable nuclide since there is not a difference in binding energy between even odd and odd even comparable to that between even even and odd odd leaving other nuclides of the same mass number isobar s free to beta decay toward the lowest mass nuclide
an effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd numbered elements such as the alkali metals tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even numbered elements
of the 26 monoisotopic element s that have only a single stable isotope all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons
beryllium is the single exception to both rules due to its low atomic number
all of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope sodium 22 and sodium 24 are trace radioisotope s produced cosmogenic ally potassium 40 and rubidium 87 have very long half lives and thus occur naturally and all isotopes of francium are radioactive
caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes
francium had not been discovered yet at that time
the natural radioisotope of potassium potassium 40 makes up about 0 012 of natural potassium and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive
this natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 the next alkali metal after caesium in 1925
caesium 137 with a half life of 30 17 years is one of the two principal medium lived fission product s along with strontium 90 which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling up to several hundred years after use
it constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the chernobyl accident
137cs undergoes high energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium 137
it is a strong emitter of gamma radiation
137cs has a very low rate of neutron capture and can not be feasibly disposed of in this way but must be allowed to decay
137cs has been used as a tracer in hydrologic studies analogous to the use of 3h
small amounts of caesium 134 and caesium 137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon test s and some nuclear accident s most notably the goiânia accident and the chernobyl disaster
as of 2005 caesium 137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the chernobyl nuclear power plant
periodic trends the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other
for instance when moving down the table all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing electronegativity increasing reactivity and decreasing melting and boiling points
in general their densities increase when moving down the table with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium
atomic and ionic radii the atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group
because of the shielding effect when an atom has more than one electron shell each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus
in the alkali metals the outermost electron only feels a net charge of 1 as some of the nuclear charge which is equal to the atomic number is cancelled by the inner electrons the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge
therefore the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells
since this number increases down the group the atomic radius must also increase down the group
the ionic radii of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii
this is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller
additionally the effective nuclear charge has increased and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases
first ionisation energy the first ionisation energy of an element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge 1
the factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge the amount of shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus which is always an outer electron in main group element s the first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels
since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feel the same effective nuclear charge 1 the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus
since this distance increases down the group the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases
this trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of the 7s orbital bringing francium s valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non relativistic calculations
this makes francium s outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium
the second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled electron shell and is thus difficult to remove
reactivity the reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group
this is the result of a combination of two factors the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals
because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reaction s thus increasing reactivity down the group
the atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals
adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to but not equal to the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance
this quantity decreases going down the group and so does the activation energy thus chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group
electronegativity electronegativity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electron s or electron density towards itself
if the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is 7 in chlorine but is only 1 in sodium
the electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom an ionic bond
however if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium
hence the larger alkali metal atoms further down the group will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them
because of the higher electronegativity of lithium some of its compounds have a more covalent character
for example lithium iodide li i will dissolve in organic solvent s a property of most covalent compounds
lithium fluoride li f is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water and lithium hydroxide li oh is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent
melting and boiling points the melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance in liquid state is the point where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas
as a metal is heated to its melting point the metallic bond s keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal s boiling point
therefore the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group
this is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons
as the atoms increase in size going down the group because their atomic radius increases the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil thus lowering the melting and boiling points
the increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect
density the alkali metals all have the same crystal structure body centred cubic and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms since density is defined as mass per unit volume
the first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius which increases going down the group thus the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group
the mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group
thus the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii if figures for these two factors are known the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated
the resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table with an exception at potassium
due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table
lithium sodium and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water
extensions although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals
being the first period 8 element the undiscovered element ununennium element 119 is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congener s however it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties
its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium
this is unusual as periodic trends ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium
this lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium s valence electron increasing ununennium s first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii this effect is already seen for francium
this assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal which although likely may not be true due to relativistic effects
the relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium s electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium indeed ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it
relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium
on the other hand ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group being expected to have a melting point between 0 ° c and 30 ° c the stabilisation of ununennium s valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240 pm very close to that of rubidium 247 pm so that the chemistry of ununennium in the 1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium
on the other hand the ionic radius of the uue ion is predicted to be larger than that of rb because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p orbitals of the lower shells
ununennium may also show the 3 oxidation state which is not seen in any other alkali metal in addition to the 1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p3 2 spinor causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected
not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium
although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 169 unhexennium under ununennium dirac fock calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually be element 165 unhexpentium which is predicted to have the electron configuration uuo 5g18 6f14 7d10 8s2 8p1 22 9s1
further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium
however the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron possibly allowing oxidation states beyond 1 and perhaps even making unhexpentium behave more like a boron group element than an alkali metal
the probable properties of the alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of 2012
in periods 8 and above of the periodic table relativistic and shell structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate
in addition the relativistic and shell structure effects which stabilise the s orbitals and destabilise and expand the d f and g orbitals of higher shells have opposite effects causing even larger difference between relativistic and non relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers
due to the alkali and alkaline earth metal s both being s block elements these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly apply to the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium ubn and unhexhexium uhh
other similar substances hydrogen the element hydrogen with one electron per neutral atom is usually placed at the top of group 1 of the periodic table for convenience but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal when it is considered to be an alkali metal it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties
under typical conditions pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule h2 however the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules such as dilithium li2 at high temperatures when they are in the gas eous state
hydrogen like the alkali metals has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogen s but the similarities end there
its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration and not its chemical properties
it is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties
the first ionisation energy of hydrogen 1312 0 kj mol is much higher than that of the alkali metals
as only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom hydrogen often behaves like a halogen forming the negative hydride ion and is sometimes considered to be a halogen
the alkali metals can also form negative ions known as alkalide s but these are little more than laboratory curiosities being unstable
under extremely high pressure s such as those found at the cores of jupiter and saturn hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal in this phase it is known as metallic hydrogen
ammonium the ammonium ion has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium and is often considered a close relative
for example most alkali metal salts are soluble in water a property which ammonium salts share
ammonium is expected to behave as a metal nh ions in a sea of electrons at very high pressures such as inside the ice giants uranus and neptune
thallium thallium displays the 1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display and thallium compounds with thallium in its 1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds due to the similar ionic radii of the tl 164 pm k 152 pm and ag 129 pm ions
it was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental europe but not in england in the years immediately following its discovery and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in dmitri mendeleev s 1869 periodic table and julius lothar meyer s 1868 periodic table
mendeleev s 1871 periodic table and meyer s 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and leave the space below caesium blank
however thallium also displays the oxidation state 3 which no known alkali metal displays although ununennium the undiscovered seventh alkali metal is predicted to possibly display the 3 oxidation state
the sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium
history etymology the alkali metals are so called because their hydroxides are all strong alkali s when dissolved in water
discovery lithium petalite li al si 4 o 10 was discovered in 1800 by the brazil ian chemist josé bonifácio de andrada in a mine on the island of utö sweden
however it was not until 1817 that johan august arfwedson then working in the laboratory of the chemist jöns jacob berzelius detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore
this new element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals
berzelius gave the unknown material the name lithion lithina from the greek word λιθoς transliterated as lithos meaning stone to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral as opposed to potassium which had been discovered in plant ashes and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood
he named the metal inside the material lithium
sodiumsodium compounds have been known since ancient times salt sodium chloride has been an important commodity in human activities as testified by the english word salary referring to salarium the wafers of salt sometimes given to roman soldiers along with their other wages
in medieval europe a compound of sodium with the latin name of sodanum was used as a headache remedy
pure sodium was not isolated until 1807 by humphry davy through the electrolysis of caustic soda now called sodium hydroxide a very similar method to the one used to isolate potassium earlier that year
potassiumwhile potash has been used since ancient times it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts
georg ernst stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702 and henri louis duhamel du monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736
the exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium was not known then and thus antoine lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789
pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in england by sir humphry davy who derived it from caustic potash koh potassium hydroxide by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile
potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis
later that same year davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda naoh lye by a similar technique demonstrating the elements and thus the salts to be different
rubidiumrubidium was discovered in 1861 in heidelberg germany by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff the first people to suggest finding new elements by spectrum analysis in the mineral lepidolite through the use of a spectroscope
because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum they chose a name derived from the latin word rubidus meaning dark red
rubidium s discovery succeeded that of caesium also discovered by bunsen and kirchhoff through spectroscopy
caesiumin 1860 robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff discovered caesium in the mineral water from dürkheim germany
due to the bright blue lines in its emission spectrum they chose a name derived from the latin word caesius meaning sky blue
caesium was the first element to be discovered spectroscopically only one year after the invention of the spectroscope by bunsen and kirchhoff
francium there were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before marguerite perey of the curie institute in paris france discovered francium in 1939 by purifying a sample of actinium 227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 kev
however perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 kev
perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product one that was separated during purification but emerged again out of the pure actinium 227
various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium radium lead bismuth or thallium
the new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal such as coprecipitating with caesium salts which led perey to believe that it was element 87 caused by the alpha decay of actinium 227
perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium 227
her first test put the alpha branching at 0 6 a figure that she later revised to 1
it was the last element discovered in nature rather than by synthesis
eka francium the next element below francium eka francium is very likely to be ununennium uue element 119 although this is not completely certain due to relativistic effects
the synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium 254 with calcium 48 ions at the superhilac accelerator at berkeley california
no atoms were identified leading to a limiting yield of 300 nb
it is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of 254es which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass relatively long half life of 270 days and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories
however given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions indeed another attempt to synthesise ununennium by bombarding a berkelium target with titanium ions is under way at the gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research in darmstadt germany
currently none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet and it is also possible due to drip instabilities that only the lower period 8 elements up to around element 128 are physically possible
no attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals such as unhexpentium due to their extremely high atomic number
occurrence in the solar system the oddo harkins rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers with the exception of hydrogen
this rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another thus increasing their atomic number
in elements with even atomic numbers protons are paired with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other enhancing stability
all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them the noble gas es and the alkaline earth metal s in the solar system
the heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesized in supernova e and not in stellar nucleosynthesis
lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesized in both big bang nucleosynthesis and in stars the big bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleon s and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple alpha process fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon and skipping over those three elements
on earth the earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the sun but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system
in turn the natural history of the earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements
the mass of the earth is approximately 5 98 kg
it is composed mostly of iron 32 1 oxygen 30 1 silicon 15 1 magnesium 13 9 sulfur 2 9 nickel 1 8 calcium 1 5 and aluminium 1 4 with the remaining 1 2 consisting of trace amounts of other elements
due to mass segregation the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron 88 8 with smaller amounts of nickel 5 8 sulfur 4 5 and less than 1 trace elements
the alkali metals due to their high reactivity do not occur naturally in pure form in nature
they are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the earth s surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica forming relatively low density minerals that do not sink down into the earth s core
potassium rubidium and caesium are also incompatible element s due to their low ionic radii
sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth both being among the ten most common elements in earth s crust sodium makes up approximately 2 6 of the earth s crust measured by weight making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal
potassium makes up approximately 1 5 of the earth s crust and is the seventh most abundant element
sodium is found in many different minerals of which the most common is ordinary salt sodium chloride which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater
other solid deposits include halite amphibole cryolite nitratine and zeolite
lithium due to its relatively low reactivity can be found in seawater in large amounts it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0 14 to 0 25 parts per million ppm or 25 micromolar
rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper
it occurs naturally in the minerals leucite pollucite carnallite zinnwaldite and lepidolite
caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements such as antimony cadmium tin and tungsten but is much less abundant than rubidium
francium 223 the only naturally occurring isotope of francium is the product of the alpha decay of actinium 227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals
in a given sample of uranium there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1018 uranium atoms
it has been calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the earth s crust at any time due to its extremely short half life of 22 minutes
production the production of pure alkali metals is difficult due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances such as water
the alkali metals are so reactive that they can not be displaced by other elements and must be isolated through electrolysis
lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral spring s brine pools and brine deposits
the metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride
potassium occurs in many minerals such as sylvite potassium chloride
it is occasionally produced through separating the potassium from the chlorine in potassium chloride but is more often produced through electrolysis of potassium hydroxide found extensively in places such as canada russia belarus germany israel united states and jordan in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s
it can also be produced from seawater
sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700 ° c through the use of a downs cell
extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide
for several years in the 1950s and 1960s a by product of the potassium production called alkarb was a main source for rubidium
alkarb contained 21 rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium
today the largest producers of caesium for example the tanco mine manitoba canada produce rubidium as by product from pollucite
today a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum cs rb al so4 2 · 12 h2o which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 different reactions
the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonne s per year
caesium however is not produced from the above reaction
instead the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium extracted from the ore mainly by three methods acid digestion alkaline decomposition and direct reduction
francium 223 the only naturally occurring isotope of francium is produced naturally as the product of the alpha decay of actinium 227
francium can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals it has been calculated that at most there are 30 g of francium in the earth s crust at any given time
as a result of its extreme rarity in nature most francium is synthesized in the nuclear reaction 197 au 18 o → 210 fr 5 n yielding francium 209 francium 210 and francium 211
the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300 000 neutral atoms which were synthesized using the nuclear reaction given above
applications all of the discovered alkali metals excluding francium have many applications
lithium is often used in batteries and lithium oxide can help process silica
lithium can also be used to make lubricating greases air treatment and aluminium production
pure sodium has many applications including use in sodium vapour lamps which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting and can help smooth the surface of other metals
sodium compounds have many applications as well the most well known compound being table salt
sodium is also used in soap as salts of fatty acid s potassium compounds are often used as fertiliser s as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition
other potassium ions are often used to hold anion s potassium hydroxide is a very strong base and is used to control the ph of various substances
rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clock s caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs it would be off by less than four seconds after 80 million years
for that reason caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second
rubidium ions are often used in purple firework s and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry
francium has no commercial applications but because of francium s relatively simple atomic structure among other things it has been used in spectroscopy experiments leading to more information regarding energy level s and the coupling constant s between subatomic particle s studies on the light emitted by laser trapped francium 210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels similar to those predicted by quantum theory
biological role and precautions lithium does not occur naturally in biological systems and has no biological role but does have effects on the body when ingested
lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder manic depression in daily doses of about 0 5 to 2 grams although there are side effects
excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness slurred speech and vomiting among other symptoms and poison s the central nervous system which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage
its biochemistry the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified
sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells
sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume blood pressure osmotic equilibrium and ph the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day
sodium chloride also known as common salt is the principal source of sodium in the diet and is used as seasoning and preservative such as for pickling and jerky most of it comes from processed foods
the dri for sodium is 1 5 grams per day but most people in the united states consume more than 2 3 grams per day the minimum amount that promotes hypertension this in turn causes 7 6 million premature deaths worldwide
potassium is the major cation positive ion inside animal cells while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells
the concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells known as the membrane potential
the balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane
the cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential — a spike of electrical discharge
the ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission muscle contraction and heart function
rubidium has no known biological role but may help stimulate metabolism and similarly to caesium replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency
caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic because of chemical similarity of caesium to potassium allowing the caesium to replace the potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency
exposure to large amounts of caesium compounds can cause hyperirritability and spasm s but as such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant
the median lethal dose ld50 value for caesium chloride in mice is 2 3 g per kilogram which is comparable to the ld50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride
caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment
radioisotope s of caesium require special precautions the improper handling of caesium 137 gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries
perhaps the best known case is the goiânia accident of 1987 in which an improperly disposed of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of goiânia brazil was scavenged from a junkyard and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious uneducated buyers
this led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure
together with caesium 134 iodine 131 and strontium 90 caesium 137 was among the isotopes distributed by the chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health
francium has no biological role and is most likely to be toxic due to its extreme radioactivity causing radiation poisoning but since the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300 000 neutral atoms it is unlikely that most people will ever encounter francium

an alphabet is a standard set of letters basic written symbols or graphemes which is used to write one or more language s based on the general principle that the letters represent phoneme s basic significant sounds of the spoken language
this is in contrast to other types of writing system s such as syllabaries in which each character represents a syllable and logograph ies in which each character represents a word morpheme or semantic unit
a true alphabet has letters for the vowel s of a language as well as the consonant s the first true alphabet in this sense is believed to be the greek alphabet which is a modified form of the phoenician alphabet
in other types of alphabet either the vowels are not indicated at all as was the case in the phoenician alphabet such systems are known as abjad s or else the vowels are shown by diacritic s or modification of consonants as in the devanagari used in india and nepal these systems are known as abugida s or alphasyllabaries
there are dozens of alphabets in use today the most popular being the latin alphabet which was derived from the greek
many languages use modified forms of the latin alphabet with additional letters formed using diacritical marks
while most alphabets have letters composed of lines linear writing there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in braille fingerspelling and morse code
alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of their letters
this makes them useful for purposes of collation specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order
it also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of numbering ordered items in such contexts as numbered list s etymology the english word alphabet came into middle english from the late latin word alphabetum which in turn originated in the greek ἀλφάβητος alphabētos from alpha and beta the first two letters of the greek alphabet
alpha and beta in turn came from the first two letters of the phoenician alphabet and originally meant ox and house respectively
history middle eastern scripts the history of the alphabet started in ancient egypt
by the 27th century bc egyptian writing had a set of some 24 hieroglyphs which are called uniliterals to represent syllables that begin with a single consonant of their language plus a vowel or no vowel to be supplied by the native speaker
these glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logogram s to write grammatical inflections and later to transcribe loan words and foreign names
in the middle bronze age an apparently alphabetic system known as the proto sinaitic script appears in egyptian turquoise mines in the sinai peninsula dated to circa the 15th century bc apparently left by canaanite workers
in 1999 john and deborah darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at wadi el hol dated to circa 1800 bc and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 bc strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed circa that time
based on letter appearances and names it is believed to be based on egyptian hieroglyphs
this script had no characters representing vowels
an alphabetic cuneiform script with 30 signs including three which indicate the following vowel was invented in ugarit before the 15th century bc
this script was not used after the destruction of ugarit
the proto sinaitic script eventually developed into the phoenician alphabet which is conventionally called proto canaanite before ca 1050 bc
the oldest text in phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of king ahiram
this script is the parent script of all western alphabets
by the tenth century two other forms can be distinguished namely canaanite and aramaic
the aramaic gave rise to hebrew
the south arabian alphabet a sister script to the phoenician alphabet is the script from which the ge ez alphabet an abugida is descended
vowelless alphabets which are not true alphabets are called abjad s currently exemplified in scripts including arabic hebrew and syriac
the omission of vowels was not a satisfactory solution and some weak consonants were used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable matres lectionis
these had dual function since they were also used as pure consonants
the proto sinatic or proto canaanite script and the ugaritic script were the first scripts with limited number of signs in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time cuneiform egyptian hieroglyphs and linear b
the phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn
another advantage of phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages since it recorded words phonemically
the script was spread by the phoenicians across the mediterranean
in greece the script was modified to add the vowels giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the west
the indication of the vowels is the same way as the indication of the consonants therefore it was the first true alphabet
the greeks took letters which did not represent sounds that existed in greek and changed them to represent the vowels
the vowels are significant in the greek language and the syllabical linear b script which was used by the mycenaean greeks from the 16th century bc had 87 symbols including 5 vowels
in its early years there were many variants of the greek alphabet a situation which caused many different alphabets to evolve from it
european alphabets the greek alphabet in its euboean form was carried over by greek colonists to the italian peninsula where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the italic languages
one of these became the latin alphabet which was spread across europe as the romans expanded their empire
even after the fall of the roman state the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works
it eventually became used for the descendant languages of latin the romance languages and then for most of the other languages of europe
some adaptations of the latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures such as æ in old english and icelandic and ȣ in algonquian by borrowings from other alphabets such as the thorn þ in old english and icelandic which came from the futhark runes and by modifying existing letters such as the eth ð of old english and icelandic which is a modified d other alphabets only use a subset of the latin alphabet such as hawaiian and italian which uses the letters j k x y and w only in foreign words
another notable script is elder futhark which is believed to have evolved out of one of the old italic alphabet s elder futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the runic alphabet s the runic alphabets were used for germanic languages from ad 100 to the late middle ages
its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood
these alphabets have since been replaced with the latin alphabet except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century
the old hungarian script is a contemporary writing system of the hungarians
it was in use during the entire history of hungary albeit not as an official writing system
from the 19th century it once again became more and more popular
the glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgical language old church slavonic and became together with the greek uncial script the basis of the cyrillic script
cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts and is notable for its use in slavic languages and also for other languages within the former soviet union
cyrillic alphabets include the serbian macedonian bulgarian and russian alphabet s the glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by saints cyril and methodius while the cyrillic alphabet was invented by the bulgarian scholar clement of ohrid who was their disciple
they feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the greek alphabet and the hebrew alphabet
asian alphabets beyond the logographic chinese writing many phonetic scripts are in existence in asia
the arabic alphabet hebrew alphabet syriac alphabet and other abjad s of the middle east are developments of the aramaic alphabet but because these writing systems are largely consonant based they are often not considered true alphabets
most alphabetic scripts of india and eastern asia are descended from the brahmi script which is often believed to be a descendant of aramaic
in korea the hangul alphabet was created by sejong the great hangul is a unique alphabet it is a featural alphabet where many of the letters are designed from a sound s place of articulation p to look like the widened mouth l to look like the tongue pulled in etc its design was planned by the government of the day and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions in the same way as chinese characters to allow for mixed script writing one syllable always takes up one type space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound block
zhuyin sometimes called bopomofo is a semi syllabary used to phonetically transcribe mandarin chinese in the republic of china
after the later establishment of the people s republic of china and its adoption of hanyu pinyin the use of zhuyin today is limited but it s still widely used in taiwan where the republic of china still governs
zhuyin developed out of a form of chinese shorthand based on chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary
like an alphabet the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual symbols but like a syllabary the phonemes of the syllable finals are not rather each possible final excluding the medial glide is represented by its own symbol
for example luan is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ l u an where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final an
while zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system it is still often used in ways similar to a romanization system — that is for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for chinese characters on computers and cellphones
european alphabets especially latin and cyrillic have been adapted for many languages of asia
arabic is also widely used sometimes as an abjad as with urdu and persian and sometimes as a complete alphabet as with kurdish and uyghur
types the term alphabet is used by linguists and paleographer s in both a wide and a narrow sense
in the wider sense an alphabet is a script that is segmental at the phoneme level — that is it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words
in the narrower sense some scholars distinguish true alphabets from two other types of segmental script abjad s and abugida s these three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed abugidas are also consonant based but indicate vowels with diacritic s to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants
in alphabets in the narrow sense on the other hand consonants and vowels are written as independent letters
the earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the wadi el hol script believed to be an abjad which through its successor phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets including arabic greek latin via the old italic alphabet cyrillic via the greek alphabet and hebrew via aramaic
examples of present day abjads are the arabic and hebrew script s true alphabets include latin cyrillic and korean hangul and abugidas are used to write tigrinya amharic hindi and thai
the canadian aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply since each glyph stands for a consonant which is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel
in a true syllabary each consonant vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph
all three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs
ugaritic for example is basically an abjad but has syllabic letters for
these are the only time vowels are indicated
cyrillic is basically a true alphabet but has syllabic letters for я е ю coptic has a letter for
devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels though some traditions use अ as a zero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels
the boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear cut
for example sorani kurdish is written in the arabic script which is normally an abjad
however in kurdish writing the vowels is mandatory and full letters are used so the script is a true alphabet
other languages may use a semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics effectively making them abugidas
on the other hand the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan abugida but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks
although short a was not written as in the indic abugidas one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet
conversely the vowel marks of the tigrinya abugida and the amharic abugida ironically the original source of the term abugida have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script
even more extreme the pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic
see below
thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels
for tonal languages further classification can be based on their treatment of tone though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types
some alphabets disregard tone entirely especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load as in somali and many other languages of africa and the americas
such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels
most commonly tones are indicated with diacritics the way vowels are treated in abugidas
this is the case for vietnamese a true alphabet and thai an abugida
in thai tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant with diacritics for disambiguation
in the pollard script an abugida vowels are indicated by diacritics but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone
more rarely a script may have separate letters for tones as is the case for hmong and zhuang
for most of these scripts regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used the most common tone is not marked just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic abugidas in zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone like the virama of indic
the number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small
the book pahlavi script an abjad had only twelve letters at one point and may have had even fewer later on
today the rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters
the hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small but it actually consists of 18 letters including the ʻokina and five long vowels
while rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent just eleven book pahlavi was small because many letters had been conflated — that is the graphic distinctions had been lost over time and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in arabic another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes
for example a comma shaped letter represented g d y k or j however such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated
in later pahlavi papyri up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all but instead each word had to be learned as a whole — that is they had become logogram s as in egyptian demotic
the alphabet in the polish language contains 32 letters
the largest segmental script is probably an abugida devanagari
when written in devanagari vedic sanskrit has an alphabet of 53 letters including the visarga mark for final aspiration and special letters for kš and jñ though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used
the hindi alphabet must represent both sanskrit and modern vocabulary and so has been expanded to 58 with the khutma letters letters with a dot added to represent sounds from persian and english
the largest known abjad is sindhi with 51 letters
the largest alphabets in the narrow sense include kabardian and abkhaz for cyrillic with 58 and 56 letters respectively and slovak for the latin script with 46
however these scripts either count di and tri graphs as separate letters as spanish did with ch and ll until recently or uses diacritic s like slovak č
the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent is probably georgian with 41 letters
syllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands
thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script
alphabetical order alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters which can then be used for purposes of collation – namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called alphabetical order
the basic ordering of the latin alphabet abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz which is derived from the northwest semitic abgad order is well established although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters such as the french é à and ô and of certain combinations of letters multigraph s
in french these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation
however in icelandic the accented letters such as á í and ö are considered to be distinct letters of the alphabet
in spanish ñ is considered a separate letter but accented vowels such as á and é are not
the ll and ch were also considered single letters but in 1994 the real academia española changed collating order so that ll is between lk and lm in the dictionary and ch is between cg and ci and in 2010 the tenth congress of the association of spanish language academies changed it so they were no longer letters at all in german words starting with sch constituting the german phoneme would be intercalated between words with initial sca and sci all incidentally loanwords instead of this graphic cluster appearing after the letter s as though it were a single letter — a lexicographical policy which would be de rigueur in a dictionary of albanian i e dh ë gj ll rr th xh and zh all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters would follow the letters d e g l n r t x and z respectively
nor is in a dictionary of english the lexical section with initial th reserved a place after the letter t but is inserted between te and ti
german words with umlaut would further be alphabetized as if there were no umlaut at all — contrary to turkish which allegedly adopted the german grapheme s ö and ü and where a word like tüfek would come after tuz in the dictionary
an exception is the german phonebook where umlauts are sorted like ä ae since names as jäger appear also with the spelling jaeger and there s no telling them apart in the spoken language
the danish and norwegian alphabet s end with æ — ø — å whereas the icelandic swedish finnish and estonian ones conventionally put å — ä — ö at the end
it is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence
some alphabets today such as the hanuno o script are learned one letter at a time in no particular order and are not used for collation where a definite order is required
however a dozen ugaritic tablets from the fourteenth century bc preserve the alphabet in two sequences
one the abcde order later used in phoenician has continued with minor changes in hebrew greek armenian gothic cyrillic and latin the other hmħlq was used in southern arabia and is preserved today in ethiopic
both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years
the historical order was abandoned in runic and arabic although arabic retains the traditional abjadi order for numbering
the brahmic family of alphabets used in india use a unique order based on phonology the letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth
this organization is used in southeast asia tibet korean hangul and even japanese kana which is not an alphabet
names of letters the phoenician letter names in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound continue to be used to varying degrees in samaritan aramaic syriac hebrew greek and arabic
the names were abandoned in latin which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel usually e before or after the consonant the exception is zeta which was retained from greek
in cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on slavic words this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in latin
orthography and pronunciation when an alphabet is adopted or developed for use in representing a given language an orthography generally comes into being providing rules for the spelling of words in that language
in accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the phoneme s significant sounds of the spoken language
in a perfectly phonemic orthography there would be a consistent one to one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling
however this ideal is not normally achieved in practice some languages such as spanish and finnish come close to it while others such as english deviate from it to a much larger degree
the pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language
languages may fail to achieve a one to one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways national languages generally elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard
however with an international language with wide variations in its dialects such as english it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet
some national languages like finnish turkish serbo croatian serbian croatian and bosnian and bulgarian have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one to one correspondence between letters and phonemes
strictly speaking these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb to spell meaning to split a word into its letters the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables
similarly the italian verb corresponding to spell out compitare is unknown to many italians because the act of spelling itself is rarely needed italian spelling is highly phonemic
in standard spanish it is possible to tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling but not vice versa this is because certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way but a given letter is consistently pronounced
french with its silent letter s and its heavy use of nasal vowel s and elision may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation but its rules on pronunciation though complex are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy
at the other extreme are languages such as english where the spelling of many words simply has to be memorized as they do not correspond to sounds in a consistent way
for english this is partly because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography was established and because english has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels
even english has general albeit complex rules that predict pronunciation from spelling and these rules are successful most of the time rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate
sometimes countries have the written language undergo a spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language
these can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself as when turkey switched from the arabic alphabet to a turkish alphabet of latin origin
the sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather small universal phonetic alphabet
a standard for this is the international phonetic alphabet

in chemistry and physics the atomic number also known as the proton number is the number of proton s found in the nucleus of an atom and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus
it is conventionally represented by the symbol z the atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element
in an atom of neutral charge the atomic number is also equal to the number of electron s the atomic number z should not be confused with the mass number a which is the number of nucleon s the total number of protons and neutron s in the nucleus of an atom
the number of neutrons n is known as the neutron number of the atom thus a z n since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes and the mass defect is usually very small compared to the mass the atomic mass of an atom is roughly equal to a atoms having the same atomic number z but different neutron number n and hence different atomic mass are known as isotope s most naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes and the average atomic mass of this mixture determines the element s atomic weight
the conventional symbol z comes from the german word meaning number numeral figure which prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics merely denoted an element s numerical place in the periodic table
only after 1915 with the suggestion and evidence that this z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms did the word and its english equivalent atomic number come into common use
history loosely speaking the existence of a periodic table creates an ordering for the elements
such an ordering is not necessarily a numbering but can be used to construct a numbering by fiat
dmitri mendeleev claimed he arranged his tables in order of atomic weight atomgewicht however in deference to the observed chemical properties he violated his own rule and placed tellurium atomic weight 127 6 ahead of iodine atomic weight 126 9
this placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number z but this number was not known or suspected at the time
a simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory
besides iodine and tellurium later several other pairs of elements such as argon and potassium cobalt and nickel were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights leaving their placement in the periodic table by chemical properties to be in violation of known physical properties
another problem was that the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar and indistinguishable lanthanide s which were of an uncertain number led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the numbering of elements at least from lutetium element 71 onwards hafnium was not known at this time
in 1911 ernest rutherford gave a model of the atom in which a central core held most of the atom s mass and a positive charge which in units of the electron s charge was to be approximately equal to half of the atom s atomic weight expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms
this central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight though it was almost 25 off the figure for the atomic number in gold z 79 a 197 the single element from which rutherford made his guess
nevertheless in spite of rutherford s estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 but was element z 79 on the periodic table a month after rutherford s paper appeared antonius van den broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was exactly equal to its place in the periodic table also known as element number atomic number and symbolized z
this proved eventually to be the case
the experimental situation improved dramatically after research by henry moseley in 1913
moseley after discussions with bohr who was at the same lab and who had used van den broek s hypothesis in his bohr model of the atom decided to test van den broek and bohr s hypothesis directly by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fit the bohr theory s demand that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to a measure of the square of z to do this moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions k and l lines produced by the elements from aluminum z 13 to gold z 79 used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an x ray tube
the square root of the frequency of these photons x rays increased from one target to the next in a linear fashion
this led to the conclusion moseley s law that the atomic number does closely correspond with an offset of one unit for k lines in moseley s work to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus i e the proton number z among other things moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive must have 15 members — no fewer and no more — which was far from obvious from the chemistry at that time
the conventional symbol z possibly comes from the german word atomic number
however prior to 1915 the word zahl simply number was used for an element s assigned number in the periodic table
chemical properties each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom which is z the atomic number
the configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics
the number of electrons in each element s electron shell s particularly the outermost valence shell is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior
hence it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of any mixture of atoms with a given atomic number
new elements the quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers
as of 2010 elements with atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been observed
synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created
in general the half life becomes shorter as atomic number increases though an island of stability may exist for undiscovered isotopes with certain numbers of protons and neutrons

anatomy from the greek anatemnō cut up cut open from ἀνά ana on upon and τέμνω temnō i cut is a branch of biology and medicine that considers the structure of living things
it is a general term that includes human anatomy animal anatomy zootomy and plant anatomy phytotomy
in some of its facets anatomy is closely related to embryology comparative anatomy and comparative embryology through common roots in evolution
anatomy is subdivided into gross anatomy or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy
gross anatomy is the study of anatomical structures that can when suitably presented or dissected be seen by unaided vision with the naked eye
microscopic anatomy is the study of minute anatomical structures on a microscopic scale
it includes histology the study of tissues and cytology the study of cells
the terms microanatomy and histology are also sometimes used synonymously in which case the distinction between histology and cell biology is n t strictly made as described here
the history of anatomy has been characterized over time by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organ s and structures in the body
methods have also improved dramatically advancing from examination of animal s through dissection of cadaver s dead human bodies to technologically complex techniques developed in the 20th century including x ray ultrasound and mri
anatomy should not be confused with anatomical pathology also called morbid anatomy or histopathology which is the study of the gross and microscopic appearances of disease d organ s superficial anatomy superficial anatomy or surface anatomy is important in anatomy being the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the contours or the surface of the body
with knowledge of superficial anatomy physician s or veterinary surgeon s gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures
superficial is a directional term that indicates one structure is located more externally than another or closer to the surface of the body
animal anatomy insect anatomy vertebrate anatomy bird anatomy reptile anatomy fish anatomy mammal anatomy human anatomy human anatomy including gross human anatomy and histology is primarily the scientific study of the morphology of the adult human body
generally students of certain biological sciences paramedic s prosthetists and orthotists physiotherapists occupational therapists nurse s and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models skeletons textbooks diagrams photographs lectures and tutorials and in addition medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadaver s the study of microscopic anatomy or histology can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations or slides under a microscope
human anatomy physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school
human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically that is respectively studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest or studying by specific systems such as the nervous or respiratory systems
the major anatomy textbook gray s anatomy has recently been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format in line with modern teaching methods
a thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties such as histopathology and radiology
academic human anatomists are usually employed by universities medical schools or teaching hospitals
they are often involved in teaching anatomy and research into certain systems organs tissues or cells

affirming the consequent sometimes called converse error or fallacy of the converse is a formal fallacy of inferring the converse from the original statement
the corresponding argument has the general form an argument of this form is invalid i e the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true
since p was never asserted as the only sufficient condition for q other factors could account for q while p was false
to put it differently if p implies q the only inference that can be made is non q implies non p
non p and non q designate the opposite propositions to p and q symbolically p ⇒ q ⇔ non q ⇒ non p the name affirming the consequent derives from the premise q which affirms the then clause of the conditional premise
examples one way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion
for example owning fort knox is not the only way to be rich
any number of other ways exist to be rich
however one can affirm with certainty that if bill gates is not rich non q then bill gates does not own fort knox non p arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing as in the following example but having the flu is not the only cause of a sore throat since many illnesses cause sore throat such as the common cold or strep throat

andrei arsenyevich tarkovsky 4 april 1932 – 29 december 1986 was a soviet and russian filmmaker writer film editor film theorist theatre and opera director
tarkovsky s films include andrei rublev solaris the mirror and stalker
he directed the first five of his seven feature films in the soviet union his last two films were produced in italy and sweden respectively
they are characterized by spirituality and metaphysical themes long takes lack of conventional dramatic structure and distinctively authored use of cinematography
film director ingmar bergman said of tarkovsky life childhood and early life tarkovsky was born in the village of zavrazhye in the yuryevetsky district of the ivanovo industrial oblast to poet and translator arseny alexandrovich tarkovsky native of kirovohrad ukraine and maria ivanova vishnyakova a graduate of the maxim gorky literature institute
andrei s grandfather aleksander tarkowski was a polish nobleman who worked as a bank clerk
tarkovsky spent his childhood in yuryevets
he was described by childhood friends as active and popular having many friends and being typically in the center of action
in 1937 his father left the family subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941
tarkovsky stayed with his mother moving with her and his sister marina to moscow where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press
in 1939 tarkovsky enrolled at the moscow school № 554
during the war the three evacuated to yuryevets living with his maternal grandmother
in 1943 the family returned to moscow
tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school where the poet andrey voznesensky was one of his classmates
he studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school
the family lived on shshipok street in the zamoskvorechye district in moscow
from november 1947 to spring 1948 he was in the hospital with tuberculosis
many themes of his childhood — the evacuation his mother and her two children the withdrawn father the time in the hospital — feature prominently in his film the mirror
following high school graduation from 1951 to 1952 tarkovsky studied arabic at the oriental institute in moscow a branch of the academy of sciences of the ussr
although he already spoke some arabic and was a successful student in his first semesters he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the academy of science institute for non ferrous metals and gold
he participated in a year long research expedition to the river kureikye near turukhansk in the krasnoyarsk province
during this time in the taiga tarkovsky decided to study film
film school student upon returning from the research expedition in 1954 tarkovsky applied at the state institute of cinematography vgik and was admitted to the film directing program
he was in the same class as irma raush whom he married in april 1957
the early khrushchev era offered unique opportunities for young film directors
before 1953 annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors
after 1953 more films were produced many of them by young directors
the khrushchev thaw relaxed soviet cultural restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of western literature films and music
this allowed tarkovsky to see films of the italian neorealists french new wave and of directors such as kurosawa buñuel bergman bresson andrzej wajda whose film ashes and diamonds was a true experience for him and mizoguchi
tarkovsky absorbed the idea of the auteur as a necessary condition for creativity
tarkovsky s teacher and mentor was mikhail romm who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors
in 1956 tarkovsky directed his first student short film the killers from a short story of ernest hemingway
the short film there will be no leave today and the screenplay concentrate followed in 1958 and 1959
an important influence on tarkovsky was the film director grigori chukhrai who was teaching at the vgik
impressed by the talent of his student chukhrai offered tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film clear skies
tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects
during his third year at the vgik tarkovsky met andrei konchalovsky
they found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films
in 1959 they wrote the script antarctica — distant country which was later published in the moskovskij komsomolets
tarkovsky submitted the script to lenfilm but it was rejected
they were more successful with the script the steamroller and the violin which they sold to mosfilm
this became tarkovsky s graduation project earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning first prize at the new york student film festival in 1961
career film career in the soviet union tarkovsky s first feature film was ivan s childhood in 1962
he had inherited the film from director eduard abalov who had to abort the project
the film earned tarkovsky international acclaim and won the golden lion award at the venice film festival in 1962
in the same year on september 30 his first son arseny called senka in tarkovsky s diaries tarkovsky was born
in 1965 he directed the film andrei rublev about the life of andrei rublev the 15th century russian icon painter
andrei rublev was not immediately released after completion due to problems with soviet authorities
tarkovsky had to cut the film several times resulting in several different versions of varying lengths
a version of the film was presented at the cannes film festival in 1969 and won the fipresci prize
the film was officially released in the soviet union in a cut version in 1971
he divorced his wife irma raush in june 1970
in the same year he married larissa kizilova née egorkina who had been a production assistant for the film andrei rublev they had been living together since 1965
their son andrei andreyevich tarkovsky was born in the same year on august 7
in 1972 he completed solaris an adaptation of the novel solaris by stanisław lem
he had worked on this together with screenwriter fridrikh gorenshtein as early as 1968
the film was presented at the cannes film festival and won the grand prix spécial du jury and the fipresci prize and was nominated for the palme d or
from 1973 to 1974 he shot the film the mirror a highly autobiographical film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father s poems
tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967 under the consecutive titles confession white day and a white white day
from the beginning the film was not well received by soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature
russian authorities placed the film in the third category which meant severe limitations on its distribution allowing it to be shown only in third class cinemas and workers clubs
few prints were made and the filmmakers received no returns
third category films also placed the filmmakers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds which could have serious effects on their future productivity
these difficulties are presumed to have made tarkovsky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the soviet film industry
during 1975 tarkovsky also worked on the screenplay hoffmanniana about the german writer and poet e t a hoffmann
in december 1976 he directed hamlet his only stage play at the lenkom theatre in moscow
the main role was played by anatoly solonitsyn who also acted in several of tarkovsky s films
at the end of 1978 he also wrote the screenplay sardor together with the writer aleksandr misharin
the last film tarkovsky completed in the soviet union was stalker inspired by the novel roadside picnic by the brothers arkady and boris strugatsky
tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986
initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel dead mountaineer s hotel and he developed a raw script
influenced by a discussion with arkady strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on roadside picnic
work on this film began in 1976
the production was mired in troubles improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots
tarkovsky s relationship with cinematographer georgy rerberg deteriorated to the point where tarkovsky hired alexander knyazhinsky as a new first cinematographer
furthermore tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in april 1978 resulting in further delay
the film was completed in 1979 and won the prize of the ecumenical jury at the cannes film festival
in the same year tarkovsky also began the production of the film the first day russian первый день pervyj dyen ′ based on a script by his friend and longterm collaborator andrei konchalovsky
the film was set in 18th century russia during the reign of peter the great and starred natalya bondarchuk and anatoli papanov in the main roles
to get the project approved by goskino tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script leaving out several scenes that were critical of the official atheism in the soviet union
after shooting roughly one half of the film the project was stopped by goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors
tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film
film career outside the soviet union during the summer of 1979 tarkovsky traveled to italy where he shot the documentary voyage in time together with his longtime friend tonino guerra
tarkovsky returned to italy in 1980 for an extended trip during which he and tonino guerra completed the script for the film nostalghia
during 1981 he traveled to the united kingdom and sweden
during his trip to sweden he had considered defecting from the soviet union but ultimately decided to return because of his wife and his son
tarkovsky returned to italy in 1982 to start shooting nostalghia
he did not return to his home country
as mosfilm withdrew from the project he had to complete the film with financial support provided by the italian rai
tarkovsky completed the film in 1983
nostalghia was presented at the cannes film festival and won the fipresci prize and the prize of the ecumenical jury
tarkovsky also shared a special prize called grand prix du cinéma de creation with robert bresson
soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the palme d or a fact that hardened tarkovsky s resolve to never work in the soviet union again
in the same year he also staged the opera boris godunov at the royal opera house in london under the musical direction of claudio abbado
he spent most of 1984 preparing the film the sacrifice
at a press conference in milan on 10 july 1984 he announced that he would never return to the soviet union and would remain in the west
at that time his son andrei jr was still in the soviet union and not allowed to leave the country
during 1985 he shot the film the sacrifice in sweden
at the end of the year he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer
in january 1986 he began treatment in paris and was joined there by his son who was finally allowed to leave the soviet union
the sacrifice was presented at the cannes film festival and received the grand prix spécial du jury the fipresci prize and the prize of the ecumenical jury
as tarkovsky was unable to attend due to his illness the prizes were collected by his son andrei jr
in tarkovsky s last diary entry 15 december 1986 he wrote but now i have no strength left — that is the problem
the diaries are sometimes also known as martyrolog and were published posthumously in 1989 and in english in 1991
tarkovsky died in paris on 29 december 1986
his funeral ceremony was held at the alexander nevsky cathedral
he was buried on 3 january 1987 in the russian cemetery in sainte geneviève des bois in france
the inscription on his grave stone which was created by the russian sculptor ernst neizvestny reads to the man who saw the angel
a controversy emerged in russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that tarkovsky did not die of natural causes but was assassinated by the kgb
evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former kgb agents who claim that viktor chebrikov gave the order to eradicate tarkovsky to curtail what the soviet government and the kgb saw as anti soviet propaganda by tarkovsky
other evidence includes several memos that surfaced after the 1991 coup and the claim by one of tarkovsky s doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause
as tarkovsky his wife larisa tarkovskaya and actor anatoli solonitsyn all died from the very same type of lung cancer vladimir sharun sound designer in stalker is convinced that they were all poisoned when shooting the film near a chemical plant
filmography tarkovsky is mainly known as a director of films
during his career he directed only seven feature films and three short films during his time at the film school
he also wrote several screenplays
he furthermore directed the play hamlet for the stage in moscow directed the opera boris godunov in london and he directed a radio production of the short story turnabout by william faulkner
he also wrote sculpting in time a book on film theory
tarkovsky s first feature film was ivan s childhood in 1962
he then directed andrei rublev in 1966 solaris in 1972 the mirror in 1975 and stalker in 1979
the documentary voyage in time was produced in italy in 1982 as was nostalghia in 1983
his last film the sacrifice was produced in sweden in 1986
tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films sometimes with a co writer
to tarkovsky a director who realizes somebody else s screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator resulting in dead and monotonous films
awards numerous awards were bestowed on tarkovsky throughout his lifetime
at the venice film festival he was awarded the golden lion
at the cannes film festival he won several times the fipresci prize the prize of the ecumenical jury and the grand prix spécial du jury
he was also nominated for the palme d or two times
in 1987 the british academy of film and television arts awarded the bafta award for best foreign language film to the sacrifice
under the influence of glasnost and perestroika tarkovsky was finally recognized in the soviet union in the autumn of 1986 shortly before his death by a retrospective of his films in moscow
after his death an entire issue of the film magazine iskusstvo kino was devoted to tarkovsky
in their obituaries the film committee of the council of ministers of the ussr and the union of soviet film makers expressed their sorrow that tarkovsky had to spend the last years of his life in exile
posthumously he was awarded the lenin prize in 1990 one of the highest state honors in the soviet union
in 1989 the andrei tarkovsky memorial prize was established with its first recipient being the russian animator yuriy norshteyn
since 1993 the moscow international film festival awards the annual andrei tarkovsky award
in 1996 the andrei tarkovsky museum opened in yuryevets his childhood town
a minor planet 3345 tarkovskij discovered by soviet astronomer lyudmila georgievna karachkina in 1982 has also been named after him
tarkovsky has been the subject of several documentaries
most notable is the 1988 documentary moscow elegy by russian film director alexander sokurov
sokurov s own work has been heavily influenced by tarkovsky
the film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from tarkovsky s films
directed by andrei tarkovsky is 1988 documentary film by michal leszczylowski an editor of the film the sacrifice
film director chris marker produced the television documentary one day in the life of andrei arsenevich as an homage to andrei tarkovsky in 2000
ingmar bergman was quoted as saying tarkovsky for me is the greatest of us all the one who invented a new language true to the nature of film as it captures life as a reflection life as a dream
film historian steven dillon claims that much of subsequent film was deeply influenced by the films of tarkovsky
at the entrance to the gerasimov institute of cinematography in moscow russia there is a monument that includes statues of tarkovsky gennady shpalikov and vasily shukshin
influences tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s a period during which soviet society opened to foreign films literature and music
this allowed tarkovsky to see films of european american and japanese directors an experience which influenced his own film making
his teacher and mentor at the film school mikhail romm allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director
tarkovsky was according to shavkat abdusalmov a fellow student at the film school fascinated by japanese films
he was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight
tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of haiku and its ability to create images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves
in 1972 tarkovsky told film historian leonid kozlov his ten favorite films
the list includes diary of a country priest and mouchette by robert bresson winter light wild strawberries and persona by ingmar bergman nazarín by luis buñuel city lights by charlie chaplin ugetsu by kenji mizoguchi seven samurai by akira kurosawa and woman in the dunes by hiroshi teshigahara
among his favorite directors were buñuel mizoguchi bergman bresson kurosawa michelangelo antonioni jean vigo and carl theodor dreyer
with the exception of city lights the list does not contain any films of the early silent era
the reason is that tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon with the early film making forming only a prelude
the list has also no films or directors from tarkovsky s native russia although he rated soviet directors such as boris barnet sergei paradjanov and alexander dovzhenko highly
although strongly opposed to commercial cinema in a famous exception tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film the terminator saying its vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art
he was critical of the brutality and low acting skills but nevertheless impressed by this film
cinematic style tarkovsky s films are characterised by metaphysical themes extremely long take s and memorable images of exceptional beauty
recurring motifs are dreams memory childhood running water accompanied by fire rain indoors reflections levitation and characters re appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera
he once said “ juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away relating a person to the whole world that is the meaning of cinema
” tarkovsky included levitation scenes into several of his films most notably solaris
to him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability
water clouds and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value as well as their symbolism such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water
bells and candles are also frequent symbols
these are symbols of film sight and sound and tarkovsky s film frequently has themes of self reflection
tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called sculpting in time
by this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it
unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time
by using long takes and few cuts in his films he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing time lost and the relationship of one moment in time to another
up to and including his film the mirror tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory
after the mirror he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by aristotle a concentrated action happening in one place within the span of a single day
several of tarkovsky s films have color or black and white sequences including for example andrei rublev which features an epilogue in color of religious icon paintings as well as solaris the mirror and stalker which feature monochrome and sepia sequences while otherwise being in color
in 1966 in an interview conducted shortly after finishing andrei rublev tarkovsky dismissed color film as a commercial gimmick and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color
he claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time
hence in film color should be used mainly to emphasize certain moments but not all the time as this distracts the viewer
to him films in color are like moving paintings or photographs which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life
vadim yusov tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer vadim yusov and much of the visual style of tarkovsky s films can be attributed to this collaboration
tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for yusov to film a single long take and due to the preparation usually only a single take was needed
sven nykvist in his last film the sacrifice tarkovsky worked with cinematographer sven nykvist who had worked closely with director ingmar bergman on many of bergman s films
nykvist complained that tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it

ambiguity of information in words pictures or other media is the ability to express more than one interpretation
it is generally contrasted with vagueness in that specific and distinct interpretations are permitted although some may not be immediately apparent whereas with information that is vague it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity
context may play a role in resolving ambiguity
for example the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another
linguistic forms the lexical ambiguity of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs
meaning hereby refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary
for instance the word bank has several distinct lexical definitions including financial institution and edge of a river
another example is as in apothecary
one could say i bought herbs from the apothecary
this could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary pharmacist or went to the apothecary pharmacy
the context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended
if for instance someone says i buried 100 in the bank most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud
however some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word
for example lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context a task referred to as word sense disambiguation
the use of multi defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning in which case a less ambiguous term should have been used
the goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver s have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed
an exception to this could include a politician whose weasel word s and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from their candidate of choice
ambiguity is a powerful tool of political science
more problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts
good for example can mean useful or functional that s a good hammer exemplary she s a good student pleasing this is good soup moral a good person versus the lesson to be learned from a story righteous etc i have a good daughter is not clear about which sense is intended
the various ways to apply prefix es and suffix es can also create ambiguity unlockable can mean capable of being unlocked or impossible to lock
syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can have two or more different meanings because of the structure of the sentence — its syntax
this is often due to a modifying expression such as a prepositional phrase the application of which is unclear
he ate the cookies on the couch for example could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch as opposed to those that were on the table or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies
to get in you will need an entrance fee of 10 or your voucher and your drivers license
this could mean that you need either ten dollars or both your voucher and your license
or it could mean that you need either ten dollars or a voucher and you also need your license
only rewriting the sentence or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity
spoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words for example ice cream and i scream
such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context
a mishearing of such based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity is called a mondegreen
semantic ambiguity happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrase — a word or phrase that has more than one meaning
we saw her duck example due to richard nordquist
the word duck can refer to the person s bird or to a motion she made
for example you could do with a new automobile
how about a test drive
the clause you could do with presents a statement with such wide possible interpretation as to be essentially meaningless
lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity
the former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context dependent interpretations
the latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations none of which may have a standard agreed upon meaning
this form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness
linguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance
intentional application philosopher s and other users of logic spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing or intentionally adding ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments
for example a politician might say i oppose taxes which hinder economic growth an example of a glittering generality
some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth
others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth
in writing the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation either by adding a comma after taxes to convey the first sense or by changing which to that to convey the second sense or by rewriting it in other ways
the devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way and think the politician supports everyone s opinion
however the opposite can also be true an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity intentionally or not
the logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases
in continental philosophy particularly phenomenology and existentialism there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition
martin heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous as is the relation of mind and body and part and whole
in heidegger s phenomenology dasein is always in a meaningful world but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification
thus although some things may be certain they have little to do with dasein s sense of care and existential anxiety e g in the face of death
in calling his work being and nothingness an essay in phenomenological ontology jean paul sartre follows heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity
simone de beauvoir tries to base an ethics on heidegger s and sartre s writings the ethics of ambiguity where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity as long as philosophers and they men have thought most of them have tried to mask it and the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued thre same goal
it has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment
ethics can not be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science
she states since we do not succeed in fleeing it let us therefore try to look the truth in the face
let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity
it is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting
other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life nature and sex are ambiguous
recently corey anton has argued that we can not be certain what is separate from or unified with something else language he asserts divides what is not in fact separate
following ernest becker he argues that the desire to authoritatively disambiguate the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide
on this basis he argues that ethics must focus on dialectically integrating opposites and balancing tension rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty
like the existentialists and phenomenologists he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity
in literature and rhetoric ambiguity can be a useful tool
groucho marx s classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor for example last night i shot an elephant in my pajamas
how he got in my pajamas i ll never know
songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect as in the song title do n t it make my brown eyes blue where blue can refer to the color or to sadness
in narrative ambiguity can be introduced in several ways motive plot character
f scott fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel the great gatsby
all religions debate the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of ambiguity
christianity and judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with ambiguity
ambiguity within christianity and other religions is resisted by the conservatives and fundamentalists who regard the concept as equating with contradiction
non fundamentalist christians and jews endorse rudolf otto s description of the sacred as mysterium tremendum et fascinans the awe inspiring mystery which fascinates humans
metonymy involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation or jargon for the name of the whole object for example wheels to refer to a car or flowers to refer to beautiful offspring an entire plant or a collection of blooming plants
in modern vocabulary critical semiotics metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity located close together or a function or process that an object performs such as sweet ride to refer to a nice car
metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humour
psychology and management in sociology and social psychology the term ambiguity is used to indicate situations that involve uncertainty
an increasing amount of research is concentrating on how people react and respond to ambiguous situations
much of this focuses on ambiguity tolerance
a number of correlations have been found between an individual s reaction and tolerance to ambiguity and a range of factors
apter and desselles 2001 for example found a strong correlation with such attributes and factors like a greater preference for safe as opposed to risk based sports a preference for endurance type activities as opposed to explosive activities a more organized and less casual lifestyle greater care and precision in descriptions a lower sensitivity to emotional and unpleasant words a less acute sense of humor engaging a smaller variety of sexual practices than their more risk comfortable colleagues a lower likelihood of the use of drugs pornography and drink a greater likelihood of displaying obsessional behavior
in the field of leadership david wilkinson 2006 found strong correlations between an individual leader s reaction to ambiguous situations and the modes of leadership they use the type of creativity kirton 2003 and how they relate to others
music in music pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous such as some polytonality polymeter other ambiguous meters or rhythm s and ambiguous phrasing or stein 2005 p 79 any aspect of music
the music of africa is often purposely ambiguous
to quote sir donald francis tovey 1935 p 195 theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value
visual art in visual art certain images are visually ambiguous such as the necker cube which can be interpreted in two ways
perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time then may flip a phenomenon called multistable perception
the opposite of such ambiguous images are impossible object s pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level the visual image is unambiguous but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear for instance
constructed language some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity especially lexical ambiguity
lojban and loglan are two related languages which have been created with this in mind focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well
the languages can be both spoken and written
these languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages although historically such attempts at language improvement have been criticized
languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency
the many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are time consuming and difficult to learn
mathematical notation mathematical notation widely used in physics and other science s avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language
however for various reasons several lexical syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain
names of functions the ambiguity in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a multivalued function which can and should be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way
several special function s still do not have established notations
usually the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument and or the resulting value sometimes the same name of the function is used causing confusions
examples of such underestablished functions expressions ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts
it is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions
also it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function for example f f x
then if one sees f f y 1 there is no way to distinguish whether it means f f x multiplied by y 1 or function f evaluated at argument equal to y 1
in each case of use of such notations the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning
creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities
many algorithmic languages c and fortran require the character as symbol of multiplication
the language mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions
fortran in addition does not allow use of the same name identifier for different objects for example function and variable in particular the expression f f x is qualified as an error
the order of operations may depend on the context
in most programming language s the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right
until the last century many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first for example a bc is interpreted as a bc in this case the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language
in addition it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis which also may lead to ambiguity
sometimes one uses italics letters to denote elementary functions
in the scientific journal style the expression s i n alpha means product of variables s i n and alpha although in a slideshow it may mean sin alpha
a comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted it is also ambiguous notation
if it is written t the reader should guess from the context does it mean a single index object evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables m n and k or it is indication to a trivalent tensor
the writing of t instead of t may mean that the writer either is stretched in space for example to reduce the publication fees or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers
the same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations
subscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function as in f
examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions sin 2 alpha 2 which could be understood to mean either sin alpha 2 2 or sin alpha 2 2
in addition sin 2 x may mean sin sin x as exp 2 x means exp exp x see tetration
sin alpha which by convention means arcsin alpha though it might be thought to mean sin alpha since sin alpha means sin alpha
a 2b which arguably should mean a 2 b but would commonly be understood to mean a 2b
notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics it is common to define the coherent states in quantum optics with alpha rangle and states with fixed number of photons with n rangle
then there is an unwritten rule the state is coherent if there are more greek characters than latin characters in the argument and n photon state if the latin characters dominate
the ambiguity becomes even worse if x rangle is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate and p rangle means the state with certain value of the momentum which may be used in books on quantum mechanics
such ambiguities easy lead to confusions especially if some normalized adimensional dimensionless variables are used
expression 1 rangle may mean a state with single photon or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1 or state with momentum equal to unity and so on
the reader is supposed to guess from the context
ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics some physical quantities do not yet have established notations their value and sometimes even dimension as in the case of the einstein coefficients depends on the system of notations
many terms are ambiguous
each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition suitable for a specific case
just like ludwig wittgenstein states in tractatus logico philosophicus only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning
a highly confusing term is gain
for example the sentence the gain of a system should be doubled without context means close to nothing
it may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled
it may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled
it may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled for example doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi two level system assuming negligible absorption of the ground state
the term intensity is ambiguous when applied to light
the term can refer to any of irradiance luminous intensity radiant intensity or radiance depending on the background of the person using the term
also confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant or resolution of an imaging system as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise
see also accuracy and precision and its talk
the berry paradox arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as definable or nameable
terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies
other terms with this type of ambiguity are satisfiable true false function property class relation cardinal and ordinal
mathematical interpretation of ambiguity in mathematics and logic ambiguity can be considered to be an underdetermined system of equations or logic – for example x y leaves open what the value of x is – while its opposite is a self contradiction also called inconsistency paradoxicalness or oxymoron in an overdetermined system – such as x 2 x 3 which has no solution – see also underdetermination
logical ambiguity and self contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and impossible object s such as the necker cube and impossible cube or many of the drawings of m c escher
pedagogic use of ambiguous expressions ambiguity can be used as a pedagogical trick to force students to reproduce the deduction by themselves
some textbooks give the same name to the function and to its fourier transform rigorously speaking such an expression requires that f 0 even if function f is a self fourier function the expression should be written as f omega frac int f t exp i omega t t however it is assumed that the shape of the function and even its norm int f x 2 x depend on the character used to denote its argument
if the greek letter is used it is assumed to be a fourier transform of another function the first function is assumed if the expression in the argument contains more characters t or tau than characters omega and the second function is assumed in the opposite case
expressions like f omega t or f y contain symbols t and omega in equal amounts they are ambiguous and should be avoided in serious deduction

the aardvark orycteropus afer is a medium sized burrowing nocturnal mammal native to africa
it is the only living species of the order tubulidentata although other prehistoric species and genera of tubulidentata are known
naming and taxonomy it is sometimes colloquially called african antbear anteater or the cape anteater after the cape of good hope
the name comes from earlier afrikaans erdvark and means earth pig or ground pig aarde earth ground vark pig because of its burrowing habits similar origin to the name groundhog
the aardvark is not closely related to the pig rather it is the sole recent representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus orycteropus the sole surviving genus in the family orycteropodidae
the aardvark is not closely related to the south america n anteater despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance
the closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrew s along with the sirenian s hyrax es tenrec s and elephant s with their extinct relatives these animals form the superorder afrotheria
the scientific name of the aardvark comes from greek ορυκτερόπους orykterópous meaning digging footed and from africa
fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years and have been located throughout europe and asia
a close relative lived in madagascar during the last ice age
description the aardvark is vaguely pig like in appearance
its body is stout with an arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs
the limbs are of moderate length
the front feet have lost the pollex or thumb resulting in four toes while the rear feet have all five toes
each toe bears a large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel like and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof
the ears which are very effective are disproportionately long and the tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers
the greatly elongated head is set on a short thick neck and the end of the snout bears a disc which houses the nostrils
the snout resembles an elongated pig snout
the mouth is small and tubular typical of species that feed on ants and termite s the aardvark has a long thin snakelike protruding tongue as much as long and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell
it has short powerful legs and compact claws
an aardvark s weight is typically between
an aardvark s length is usually between and can reach lengths of when its tail which can be up to is taken into account
it is the largest member of the proposed clade afroinsectiphilia
the aardvark is pale yellowish gray in color and often stained reddish brown by soil
the aardvark s coat is thin and the animal s primary protection is its tough skin
the aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest which also serves as protection from its predator s one of the most distinctive characteristics of the tubulidentata is their teeth
instead of having a pulp cavity each tooth has a cluster of thin upright parallel tubes of vasodentin a modified form of dentine with individual pulp canals held together by cementum
the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously
the aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw which fall out and are not replaced
adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw and have a dental formula of these remaining teeth are peg like and rootless and are of unique composition
the teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars
gene tically speaking the aardvark is a living fossil as its chromosome s are highly conserved reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa
habitat and range aardvarks live in sub saharan africa where there is suitable habitat for them to live such as savanna s grassland s woodland s and bushland and available food i e ants and termites
the only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest
they have been documented as high as in ethiopia
they are known to live throughout sub saharan africa all the way to south africa with few exceptions
these exceptions are coastal areas of namibia ivory coast and ghana
they are also not present in madagascar
ecology and behavior the aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ant s and termite s formicivore the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber
an aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over a considerable home range encompassing 10 to 30 km swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food
when a concentration of ants or termites is detected the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long sticky tongue — as many as 50 000 in one night have been recorded
it can dig 2 feet in 15 seconds but otherwise moves fairly slowly
